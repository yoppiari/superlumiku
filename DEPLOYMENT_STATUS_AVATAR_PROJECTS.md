## ⏳ Pending Steps

### 5. Database Migration ⏳
**Action Required:** User must execute SQL migration

**Options:**
1. **Via Coolify Database UI** (Recommended)
   - Go to Coolify → Database → Terminal
   - Copy-paste content from `AVATAR_PROJECT_MIGRATION_SQL.sql`
   - Execute

2. **Via SSH + psql**
   - SSH to server
   - Run: `docker exec -it coolify-db psql -U postgres -d lumiku`
   - Paste SQL

3. **Via Coolify App Terminal**
   - App → Terminal
   - Run: `cd /app/backend && bunx prisma migrate deploy`
   - Then: `bun run scripts/migrate-avatars-to-projects.ts`

**What it does:**
- Creates `avatar_projects` table
- Adds `project_id` column to `avatars`
- Migrates existing avatars to default "My Avatars" project per user
- Applies foreign key constraints

### 6. Verification ⏳
**After migration, check:**

**Database:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM avatars WHERE project_id IS NULL;
-- Should return: 0
```

**Backend API:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://app.lumiku.com/api/apps/avatar-creator/projects
# Should return: { "projects": [...] }
```

**Frontend:**
- Visit: https://app.lumiku.com
- Login
- Go to Avatar Creator
- Should see: **Projects list** (not flat avatar list)

## 🎯 What Changed

### Database Schema
```diff
+ avatar_projects table (NEW)
  - id, user_id, name, description, created_at, updated_at

  avatars table (MODIFIED)
+ - project_id column (NEW)
+ - Foreign key to avatar_projects
+ - CASCADE delete
```

### Backend API (9 new endpoints)
```
NEW Routes:
GET    /api/apps/avatar-creator/projects
POST   /api/apps/avatar-creator/projects
GET    /api/apps/avatar-creator/projects/:id
PUT    /api/apps/avatar-creator/projects/:id
DELETE /api/apps/avatar-creator/projects/:id
GET    /api/apps/avatar-creator/projects/:id/stats
POST   /api/apps/avatar-creator/projects/:id/avatars
POST   /api/apps/avatar-creator/projects/:id/avatars/generate
DELETE /api/apps/avatar-creator/avatars/:id

LEGACY Routes (kept for backward compatibility):
GET    /api/apps/avatar-creator/avatars
GET    /api/apps/avatar-creator/stats
```

### Frontend UI
**Before:**
- Flat list of all avatars
- Upload & Generate buttons always visible

**After:**
- Two-view system:
  1. **Projects List View** - Shows project cards with "New Project" button
  2. **Project Detail View** - Shows avatars in selected project, Upload & Generate buttons

**New Features:**
- Create, edit, delete projects
- Organize avatars by project
- Project stats (avatar count)
- Modal-based upload and AI generation
- Integration with Pose Generator preserved

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Zero Downtime Deployment** ✅
   - App is live and accessible
   - New code deployed but old features still work
   - Migration can run while app is running

2. **Backward Compatibility** ✅
   - Legacy API routes still work
   - No breaking changes for existing integrations
   - Users can continue using app

3. **Idempotent Migration** ✅
   - Safe to run multiple times
   - Won't create duplicate data
   - Uses IF NOT EXISTS checks

4. **Rollback Plan** ✅
   - Simple SQL rollback available
   - Can revert code via git
   - Database backup recommended (do first!)
