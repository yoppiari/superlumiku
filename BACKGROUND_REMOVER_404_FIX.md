# Background Remover 404 Fix - Production Deployment

**Status**: Endpoint returning 404 after successful deployment
**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Issue**: Prisma client not regenerated, application needs restart

---

## Problem Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- Plugin registered in `loader.ts` (lines 21-22, 34)
- Database schema includes all 4 Background Remover models (schema.prisma lines 1224-1392)
- Application health check: **PASSING** (200 OK)
- Git deployment: **SUCCESS** (commit e3f2786)
- HuggingFace API key: **CONFIGURED** in Coolify

### ‚ùå What's Failing:
- Endpoint `/api/background-remover/pricing` returns 404

### üîç Root Cause:
Prisma client on production server doesn't know about new models. When the app starts, Prisma client was generated BEFORE the Background Remover models were added to schema.

---

## Fix Steps (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Option 1: Via Coolify Terminal (RECOMMENDED)

#### Step 1: Access Coolify Terminal
1. Go to: https://cf.avolut.com
2. Navigate to: **dev-superlumiku** application
3. Click: **Terminal** tab

#### Step 2: Run These Commands
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd /app/backend

# Generate Prisma client with new models
npx prisma generate

# Verify generation successful
echo "‚úÖ Prisma client regenerated"

# Exit terminal
exit
```

#### Step 3: Restart Application
```bash
# Option A: Via Docker (if using Docker)
docker restart d8ggwoo484k8ok48g8k8cgwk

# Option B: Via PM2 (if using PM2)
pm2 restart backend

# Option C: Via Coolify UI
# Go to Application > Actions > Restart
```

#### Step 4: Verify Fix
```bash
# Wait 30 seconds for app to start, then test
curl https://dev.lumiku.com/api/background-remover/pricing

# Expected response:
# {
#   "tiers": {
#     "basic": { "name": "Basic", "credits": 3, ... },
#     "standard": { "name": "Standard", "credits": 8, ... },
#     ...
#   }
# }
```

### Option 2: Via Coolify API (Alternative)

If you can't access terminal, redeploy with force:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://cf.avolut.com/api/v1/deploy?uuid=d8ggwoo484k8ok48g8k8cgwk&force=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 6|F8fuUh0PBuxLkX6aizP74MfczFueW6TjL5fBdSG57c7177d8"
```

This will rebuild the entire app including Prisma generation.

---

### Option 3: Add to Deployment Script (PERMANENT FIX)

To prevent this in future, add Prisma generation to your build process.

#### Check Current Build Command:
In Coolify > Application > Build Settings, check if there's a build command or Dockerfile.

#### If using Multi-stage Docker (Recommended):
Your Dockerfile should already have this in backend build stage:
```dockerfile
# Backend build stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS backend-builder
WORKDIR /app/backend
COPY backend/package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY backend/ ./
RUN npx prisma generate  # ‚Üê This should be here
RUN npm run build
```

#### If using PM2 or direct node:
Add to `package.json` scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx prisma generate && bun run build",
    "start": "npx prisma generate && bun run src/index.ts"
  }
}
```

## Verification Checklist

After running fix steps, verify:

- [ ] **Health endpoint working**:
  ```bash
  curl https://dev.lumiku.com/api/health
  # Should return: {"status":"ok",...}
  ```

- [ ] **Pricing endpoint working**:
  ```bash
  curl https://dev.lumiku.com/api/background-remover/pricing
  # Should return tier pricing data
  ```

- [ ] **Check application logs**:
  ```bash
  # Via Docker
  docker logs d8ggwoo484k8ok48g8k8cgwk --tail 50

  # Via PM2
  pm2 logs backend --lines 50

  # Look for:
  # ‚úÖ "Loaded 6 plugins"
  # ‚úÖ "background-remover: ENABLED"
  ```

- [ ] **Test with authentication** (requires valid JWT token):
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://dev.lumiku.com/api/background-remover/pricing/calculate \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"tier":"basic","imageCount":10}'

  # Should return calculated pricing with volume discounts
  ```

## Why This Happened

### Timeline:
1. **Oct 17, 23:30** - Background Remover schema added to `schema.prisma`
2. **Oct 17, 23:45** - Deployed to Coolify (commit e3f2786)
3. **Oct 17, 23:54** - Build completed, app restarted
4. **Issue**: Prisma client generated BEFORE deployment, doesn't include new models

### Prisma Client Generation:
Prisma client is code-generated based on schema.prisma:
- When schema changes, you must run `npx prisma generate`
- This creates TypeScript types and database client methods
- Without regeneration, TypeScript errors occur (or 404 if routes depend on models)

### Why It's Not Auto-Generated:
Some build processes include automatic Prisma generation:
```bash
"postinstall": "npx prisma generate"
```

But this only runs during `npm install`, not during app restart.

## Next Steps After Fix

### 1. Test All Endpoints (Priority: HIGH)

**Single Image Removal**:
```bash
# Upload image and remove background
curl -X POST https://dev.lumiku.com/api/background-remover/remove \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -F "image=@test-image.jpg" \
  -F "tier=basic"
```

**Batch Processing**:
```bash
# Upload multiple images
curl -X POST https://dev.lumiku.com/api/background-remover/batch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -F "images=@image1.jpg" \
  -F "images=@image2.jpg" \
  -F "tier=standard" \
  -F "imageCount=2"
```

**Check Batch Status**:
```bash
curl https://dev.lumiku.com/api/background-remover/batch/BATCH_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### 2. Start Queue Worker (Priority: CRITICAL)

Background Remover uses BullMQ for batch processing. Start the worker:

```bash
# Via PM2 (recommended)
cd /app/backend
pm2 start --name "background-remover-worker" bun -- run src/apps/background-remover/workers/batch-processor.worker.ts

# Verify worker running
pm2 list
# Should show: background-remover-worker | online

# Monitor worker logs
pm2 logs background-remover-worker --lines 50
```

### 3. Monitor Production (Priority: HIGH)

Watch for errors in first 24 hours:

```bash
# Application logs
pm2 logs backend --lines 100

# Look for:
# ‚úÖ "Background removed successfully" (basic tier)
# ‚úÖ "Batch processing started" (batch jobs)
# ‚ùå "HuggingFace rate limit exceeded" (429 error)
# ‚ùå "Model loading" (503 cold start - expected, retries after 20s)
```

### 4. Performance Baseline

Test processing times match expectations:
- **Basic (RMBG-1.4)**: 2-5 seconds
- **Standard (RMBG-2.0)**: 5-10 seconds
- **Professional (RMBG-2.0)**: 5-10 seconds
- **Industry (RMBG-2.0)**: 5-10 seconds

If slower:
- Check HuggingFace API status
- Monitor for cold starts (503 ‚Üí 20s wait ‚Üí retry)
- Verify network latency to HuggingFace

---

## Troubleshooting

### If endpoint still returns 404 after Prisma generation:

1. **Check if plugin loaded**:
   ```bash
   docker logs d8ggwoo484k8ok48g8k8cgwk 2>&1 | grep "background-remover"
   # Should show: "background-remover: ENABLED"
   ```

2. **Verify routes mounted**:
   ```bash
   # Check if routes.ts imports are correct
   grep -r "backgroundRemoverRoutes" /app/backend/src/plugins/loader.ts
   # Should show import and registry.register call
   ```

3. **Check TypeScript compilation**:
   ```bash
   cd /app/backend
   npx tsc --noEmit
   # Should compile without errors
   ```

4. **Database migration needed?**:
   ```bash
   cd /app/backend
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   # Run pending migrations
   ```

5. **Full rebuild**:
   If all else fails, trigger complete rebuild via Coolify API:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://cf.avolut.com/api/v1/deploy?uuid=d8ggwoo484k8ok48g8k8cgwk&force=true&cleanup=true" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer 6|F8fuUh0PBuxLkX6aizP74MfczFueW6TjL5fBdSG57c7177d8"
   ```
