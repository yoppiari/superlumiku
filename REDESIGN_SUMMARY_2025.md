## How to Test the Prototype

1. Open `lumiku-desktop-webapp-2025.html` in your browser
2. Try these interactions:
   - Click sidebar toggle (top-left) to collapse/expand
   - Click category filters to filter apps
   - Press Ctrl+K (or Cmd+K on Mac) to open command palette
   - Type in command palette to search
   - Use arrow keys to navigate command palette results
   - Click any app card (will show navigation alert)

## Visual Design Philosophy

### What We Avoided
- ‚ùå Heavy gradients (feedback: too busy)
- ‚ùå Pure flat design (feedback: too boring)
- ‚ùå Mobile-first patterns (feedback: not appropriate)
- ‚ùå Excessive animations
- ‚ùå Trendy but dated styles

### What We Embraced
- ‚úÖ Subtle depth (shadows + borders)
- ‚úÖ Clean lines and spacing
- ‚úÖ Purposeful color (not decorative)
- ‚úÖ Micro-interactions (hover, focus)
- ‚úÖ Timeless patterns (sidebar, command palette)
