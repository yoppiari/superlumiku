# 🚨 ACTION REQUIRED - Pose Generator Fix

**Status**: ✅ CODE DEPLOYED | ⏳ DATABASE SEED PENDING
**Deployment UUID**: `acgs44o8o4ow4w4ocsw0woc0`
**Date**: October 16, 2025

## 📋 WHAT WAS DONE (Already Complete)

✅ **Root Cause Identified**
- Pose Generator invisible because FREE tier users had 0 accessible AI models
- Dashboard filters apps by `getUserAccessibleModels()` - 0 models = hidden
- Previous models were only BASIC/PRO tier

✅ **Fix Implemented**
- Added FREE tier model: `flux-controlnet-free`
- 15 credits, 512x512 resolution, 15-30s processing
- Code committed: `e62a4d3`
- Deployed to Coolify: `acgs44o8o4ow4w4ocsw0woc0`

✅ **Documentation Created**
- Complete troubleshooting guides
- Exact copy-paste commands
- Technical analysis with code references

## ⚡ WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW (3 Minutes)

### Step 1: Access Coolify Terminal (30 seconds)

1. Go to: **https://cf.avolut.com**
2. Click **"SuperLumiku"** application
3. Click **"Terminal"** or **"Console"** button

---

### Step 2: Run This Command (1 minute)

**Copy-paste this EXACT command:**

```bash
cd /app/backend && bun prisma/seed.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🌱 Starting database seeding...
✅ Seeded 4 subscription plans
✅ Seeded 18 AI models (including 4 for pose-generator)
✅ Seeded 33 categories
✅ Seeded 150+ poses
✅ Database seeding completed successfully!
```

---

### Step 3: Verify Fix (1 minute)

1. **Open browser**: https://dev.lumiku.com/dashboard
2. **Hard refresh**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
3. **Login** if needed
4. **Look for Pose Generator card**

**✅ SUCCESS = Pose Generator card appears!**

---

## 🔍 VERIFICATION COMMANDS (Optional)

If you want to double-check the fix worked:

```bash
# Check model count (should return 4)
cd /app/backend && node -e "const {PrismaClient}=require('@prisma/client');const p=new PrismaClient();p.aIModel.count({where:{appId:'pose-generator'}}).then(c=>{console.log('Pose Generator models:',c);p.\$disconnect();})"

# List all models with tiers
cd /app/backend && node -e "const {PrismaClient}=require('@prisma/client');const p=new PrismaClient();p.aIModel.findMany({where:{appId:'pose-generator'}}).then(m=>{m.forEach(x=>console.log(x.modelId,'('+x.tier+' tier, '+x.creditCost+' credits)'));p.\$disconnect();})"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Pose Generator models: 4

flux-controlnet-free (free tier, 15 credits)       ← NEW!
flux-controlnet-standard (basic tier, 30 credits)
flux-controlnet-pro (pro tier, 40 credits)
background-changer-sam (basic tier, 10 credits)
```

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem 1: Command fails with "Cannot find module '@prisma/client'"

**Solution:**
```bash
cd /app/backend && bun prisma generate
cd /app/backend && bun prisma/seed.ts
```

---

### Problem 2: Seed completes but model count still 3 (not 4)

**Cause**: Deployment hasn't pulled latest seed file yet

**Solution**: Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete, then retry:
```bash
cd /app/backend && bun prisma/seed.ts
```

---

### Problem 3: Pose Generator still not visible after seeding

**Check 1 - User Tier:**
```bash
# Verify you're logged in as FREE/BASIC/PRO user (not unauthenticated)
```

**Check 2 - Browser Cache:**
- Clear cache: `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

**Check 3 - API Response:**
```bash
# Test API endpoint (replace with real JWT token)
curl https://dev.lumiku.com/api/apps \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  | jq '.apps[] | select(.id=="pose-generator")'
```

## 📊 WHAT CHANGED

### Before Fix:
```
FREE tier user → 0 accessible models → Pose Generator HIDDEN ❌
BASIC tier user → 2 accessible models → Pose Generator VISIBLE ✅
PRO tier user → 3 accessible models → Pose Generator VISIBLE ✅
```

### After Fix:
```
FREE tier user → 1 accessible model → Pose Generator VISIBLE ✅
BASIC tier user → 3 accessible models → Pose Generator VISIBLE ✅
PRO tier user → 4 accessible models → Pose Generator VISIBLE ✅
```

**Impact**: ALL users can now see and use Pose Generator with tier-appropriate quality/pricing.

## 📝 TECHNICAL SUMMARY

**Problem**: Dashboard filters apps by accessible AI models. FREE tier users had 0 accessible models for Pose Generator (all models were BASIC/PRO tier) → app hidden.

**Solution**: Added FREE tier model with appropriate specs:
- Model: `flux-controlnet-free`
- Provider: Hugging Face (FLUX.1-schnell)
- Tier: `free` (critical for visibility)
- Cost: 15 credits
- Quality: Basic (512x512, 15-30s)

**Files Modified**: `backend/prisma/seeds/ai-models.seed.ts` (lines 213-244)

**Deployment**: Commit `e62a4d3` → Coolify UUID `acgs44o8o4ow4w4ocsw0woc0`

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP

**👉 Open `COPY_PASTE_COOLIFY_COMMANDS.txt` and follow the instructions.**

That file contains the EXACT commands to run in Coolify terminal to complete the fix.
