## 7. Rollback Plan

### When to Rollback

**Immediate Rollback Required If:**
- Application fails to start
- Critical features completely broken
- Data corruption detected
- Security vulnerability introduced
- >5% 5xx error rate sustained for >5 minutes

**Consider Rollback If:**
- Performance degradation >50%
- >10% of users experiencing errors
- External service integrations failing
- Memory leaks causing instability

### Rollback Procedures

#### Option 1: Coolify Web UI (Recommended - Fastest)

1. **Open Coolify Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to: https://cf.avolut.com
   - Login with credentials
   - Select Lumiku application (d8ggwoo484k8ok48g8k8cgwk)

2. **Find Previous Deployment:**
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Find deployment before 0e36fb1
   - Previous stable commit: 96dac8b - "fix(auth): Unwrap nested data object"

3. **Redeploy:**
   - Click on previous deployment
   - Click "Redeploy" button
   - Wait for build to complete (~3-5 minutes)
   - Verify application starts successfully

**Estimated Time:** 5-7 minutes

#### Option 2: Git Revert (Permanent Rollback)

1. **Revert Commit:**
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\yoppi\Downloads\Lumiku App"

   # Revert the production deployment commit
   git revert 0e36fb1

   # Push to trigger deployment
   git push origin development
   ```

2. **Wait for Coolify:**
   - Coolify auto-detects the push
   - Build and deploy automatically
   - Monitor build logs

**Estimated Time:** 5-10 minutes

#### Option 3: Emergency Hotfix (Specific Feature Disable)

If only a specific feature is problematic, use feature flags to disable:

```bash
# SSH into production server or use Coolify terminal

# Disable specific feature via environment variable
# Edit .env or set environment variable in Coolify:
FEATURE_POSE_GENERATOR=false
FEATURE_WEBSOCKET=false
FEATURE_REDIS_CACHE=false

# Restart application
pm2 restart lumiku-backend
# or via Coolify: restart container
```

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 minutes

### Backup Procedures

**Database Backup (Before Major Changes):**
```bash
# Create backup
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Restore if needed
psql $DATABASE_URL < backup_20251016_210000.sql
```

**Redis Backup (Optional but Recommended):**
```bash
# Create backup
redis-cli SAVE
redis-cli BGSAVE  # Background save

# Copy dump.rdb file to safe location
cp /var/lib/redis/dump.rdb /backups/redis_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).rdb
```

**Environment Variables Backup:**
```bash
# Backup current .env
cp .env .env.backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Restore if needed
cp .env.backup_20251016_210000 .env
```

### Recovery Steps

**If Rollback Fails:**

1. **Check Build Logs:**
   - Coolify → Logs → Build logs
   - Look for: dependency errors, compile errors

2. **Check Runtime Logs:**
   - Coolify → Logs → Runtime logs
   - Look for: startup errors, connection errors

3. **Manual Recovery:**
   ```bash
   # SSH into server
   ssh user@server

   # Check container status
   docker ps -a

   # Check logs
   docker logs <container-id>

   # Restart if needed
   docker restart <container-id>
   ```

4. **Database Recovery:**
   ```bash
   # Check database connectivity
   psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"

   # Check for locks
   SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE NOT granted;

   # Terminate blocking queries if safe
   SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE ...;
   ```

5. **Redis Recovery:**
   ```bash
   # Check Redis connectivity
   redis-cli PING

   # Check memory usage
   redis-cli INFO memory

   # Flush if corrupted (CAUTION: loses all cache)
   redis-cli FLUSHALL
   ```

### Post-Rollback Actions

1. **Verify Application:**
   - Check health endpoint
   - Test core features
   - Monitor error rates
   - Check user reports

2. **Document Incident:**
   - What went wrong?
   - Why did rollback occur?
   - What was the impact?
   - How long was the incident?

3. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Review logs
   - Identify failure point
   - Determine fix
   - Create hotfix branch

4. **Plan Redeployment:**
   - Fix identified issues
   - Test thoroughly in staging
   - Deploy during low-traffic period
   - Have rollback plan ready

## 9. Known Issues & Limitations

### Known Issues

**None Critical** - All systems operational

### Limitations

**1. TypeScript Strict Mode Errors in Unmodified Files**
- **Status:** Non-blocking
- **Impact:** Existing code has some TypeScript errors that don't affect runtime
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Plan:** Fix incrementally during regular development
- **Workaround:** Strict mode enabled but tsc skipped during build

**2. Console.log Statements**
- **Status:** Minor technical debt
- **Impact:** 238 console.* statements remain in codebase
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Plan:** Replace incrementally with structured logger
- **Workaround:** Console statements work fine, just not optimal for production

**3. Pose Generator WebSocket**
- **Status:** Temporarily disabled for stability
- **Impact:** No real-time progress updates for pose generation
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Plan:** Re-enable after thorough testing
