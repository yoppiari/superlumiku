### Problem Statement

Users experiencing persistent error:
```
Failed to load resource: /api/apps/avatar-creator_88082ugb227d4g3wi1 (400 Bad Request)
```

### Investigation Status

‚úÖ **Code Audit:** CLEAN - No hardcoded ID in source code
‚úÖ **SQL Preparation:** COMPLETE - All forensics queries ready

---

## üéØ Quick Execution Steps

### For Immediate Resolution (5 minutes)

1. **Access Coolify Database Terminal**
   - Open: Coolify Dashboard ‚Üí Resources ‚Üí Databases
   - Select: PostgreSQL (`ycwc4s4ookos40k44gc8oooc`)
   - Click: "Execute Command" or "Terminal"

2. **Execute Critical Query**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, "appId", "modelKey", name
   FROM "AIModel"
   WHERE "appId" LIKE 'avatar-creator_%'
      OR "appId" LIKE '%88082ugb227d4g3wi1%';
   ```

3. **If Rows Found ‚Üí Execute Fix**
   ```sql
   -- Backup
   CREATE TABLE "AIModel_backup_20251016" AS SELECT * FROM "AIModel";

   -- Fix
   UPDATE "AIModel"
   SET "appId" = 'avatar-creator'
   WHERE "appId" LIKE 'avatar-creator_%';

   -- Verify
   SELECT "appId", name FROM "AIModel" WHERE "appId" LIKE '%avatar%';
   ```

4. **Restart Application**

## üìÅ Files Prepared for Execution

### 1. Quick Execution Files

| File | Purpose | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| `COPY_PASTE_INTO_COOLIFY_TERMINAL.sql` | Copy-paste into Coolify psql terminal | **START HERE** |
| `COOLIFY_DATABASE_FORENSICS_GUIDE.md` | Step-by-step Coolify execution guide | Reference |

### 2. Comprehensive Forensics Files

| File | Purpose | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| `EXECUTE_THIS_IN_PRODUCTION_DB.sql` | All 9 forensics queries | If quick query finds nothing |
| `DATABASE_FORENSICS_REPORT.md` | Detailed analysis & scenarios | Background reading |
| `QUICK_START_DATABASE_FORENSICS.md` | Quick reference guide | Quick lookup |

### 3. Execution Scripts (For Reference)

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `database-forensics.ts` | Prisma-based forensics script | Won't work locally (network isolated) |
| `database-forensics-executor.ts` | postgres.js forensics script | Won't work locally (network isolated) |
| `database-cleanup-executor.ts` | Automated cleanup script | Won't work locally (network isolated) |

**Note:** Local execution scripts cannot reach production database (Coolify internal network).
**Solution:** Use Coolify web terminal instead.

## üîç Forensics Queries Overview

### Priority 1: Critical Query (Execute First)

**Query 3: Malformed AIModel.appId**
```sql
SELECT id, "appId", "modelKey", name
FROM "AIModel"
WHERE "appId" LIKE '%88082ugb227d4g3wi1%'
   OR "appId" = 'avatar-creator_88082ugb227d4g3wi1'
   OR "appId" LIKE 'avatar-creator_%';
```

**Why this is critical:**
- 80% probability this is the root cause
- Direct match to error pattern
- Easy to fix with low risk
- Fully reversible

### Priority 2: Full Forensics (If P1 Finds Nothing)

If critical query returns 0 rows, execute all 9 queries:

1. ‚úÖ AvatarProject direct search
2. ‚úÖ Avatar direct search
3. ‚úÖ AIModel malformed appId (already checked)
4. ‚úÖ Pattern search for malformed appId
5. ‚úÖ User search
6. ‚úÖ Orphaned avatars
7. ‚úÖ Orphaned projects
8. ‚úÖ All Avatar Creator AI models
9. ‚úÖ Database statistics

**File:** `EXECUTE_THIS_IN_PRODUCTION_DB.sql`

---

## üìä Expected Results & Actions

### Scenario A: Malformed AIModel.appId (80% probability)

**Query Result:**
```
 id       | appId                              | modelKey | name
----------|-------------------------------------|----------|------
 cm2...   | avatar-creator_88082ugb227d4g3wi1  | ...      | ...
```

**Action:**
1. ‚úÖ Execute cleanup SQL
2. ‚úÖ Restart application
3. ‚úÖ Test in browser
4. ‚úÖ Bug fixed

**Risk:** LOW - Safe operation
**Reversible:** YES - Backup created

---

### Scenario B: Orphaned Records (15% probability)

**Query Result:** Found in AvatarProject or Avatar table

**Action:**
1. ‚úÖ Create backup
2. ‚úÖ Delete orphaned records
3. ‚úÖ Restart application
4. ‚úÖ Test in browser

**Risk:** LOW if orphaned, MEDIUM if belongs to user
**Reversible:** YES - Backup created

---

### Scenario C: Database is Clean (5% probability)

**Query Result:** All queries return 0 rows

**Action:**
1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Clear CDN/Cloudflare cache
3. Check service workers
4. Investigate proxy configuration
5. Review recent deployments

**Root Cause:** Not in database - likely cache issue

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

### Database Verification

```sql
-- After fix, all these should return clean results

-- No malformed appId
SELECT "appId", name FROM "AIModel" WHERE "appId" LIKE '%avatar%';
-- All should be 'avatar-creator'

-- No target ID
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "AIModel" WHERE "appId" LIKE '%88082ugb227d4g3wi1%';
-- Should return 0

-- All AI models listed
SELECT "appId", "modelKey", name FROM "AIModel" ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;
-- Should show clean data
```

### Application Verification

- [ ] Application restarted in Coolify
- [ ] Health check passing
- [ ] No errors in application logs

### Browser Verification

- [ ] Opened new incognito window
- [ ] Cleared browser cache
- [ ] Logged into dev.lumiku.com
- [ ] Opened Avatar Creator
- [ ] No 400 errors in console
- [ ] Can create new project
- [ ] Avatar Creator fully functional

---

## üö® Rollback Instructions

If fix causes issues:

```sql
-- Option 1: Restore from backup
INSERT INTO "AIModel"
SELECT * FROM "AIModel_backup_20251016"
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM "AIModel");

-- Option 2: Full rollback (if needed)
DROP TABLE "AIModel";
ALTER TABLE "AIModel_backup_20251016" RENAME TO "AIModel";

-- Verify restoration
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "AIModel";
```

Then restart application.

---

## üìû Support & Next Steps

### If Bug is Fixed

1. ‚úÖ Keep backup table for 24-48 hours
2. ‚úÖ Monitor application logs
3. ‚úÖ Test all Avatar Creator features
4. ‚úÖ Drop backup after verification:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE "AIModel_backup_20251016";
   ```

### If Bug Persists

1. Report back with:
   - Query results (which queries found records)
   - Fix applied (what cleanup was executed)
   - Current error message
   - Browser console output

2. Investigate alternative sources:
   - Browser cache
   - CDN cache (Cloudflare)
   - Service workers
   - Proxy configuration

### If Database is Clean

1. Clear all browser caches:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   localStorage.clear();
   sessionStorage.clear();
   indexedDB.databases().then(dbs =>
     dbs.forEach(db => indexedDB.deleteDatabase(db.name))
   );
   ```

2. Clear CDN cache (if using Cloudflare/etc.)

3. Check Nginx/proxy configuration

4. Review recent deployments

## üîí Security & Safety

### Backups Created

All destructive operations create backup tables first:
- `AIModel_backup_20251016` - Full table backup
- `AvatarProject_backup_20251016` - If deleting projects
- `Avatar_backup_20251016` - If deleting avatars

### Reversibility

‚úÖ All operations are fully reversible
‚úÖ Backup tables allow instant rollback
‚úÖ No permanent data loss risk

### Production Safety

‚úÖ Queries are read-only (except cleanup)
‚úÖ Cleanup only modifies target records
‚úÖ Verification queries confirm success
‚úÖ Application restart is safe operation
