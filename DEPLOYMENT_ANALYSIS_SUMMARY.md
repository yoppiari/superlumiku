# Pose Generator Deployment Analysis - Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Analyst:** Claude Code (Lumiku Deployment Specialist)
**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL BLOCKER IDENTIFIED

---

## TL;DR

**Problem:** Pose Generator runs perfectly on localhost but is INVISIBLE on dev.lumiku.com

**Root Cause:** Zero AI models in production database seed

**Solution:** Add 3 AI models to `ai-models.seed.ts` ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Run seed

**Time to Fix:** 15 minutes

---

## CURRENT STATUS

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **Backend:** 100% complete
  - Plugin registered in `loader.ts`
  - Routes configured
  - Worker implemented
  - Queue system ready (BullMQ + Redis)
  - WebSocket support enabled
  - Database seeds for categories + poses (150+ poses)

- **Frontend:** 100% complete
  - React components built
  - React Router integrated
  - Dashboard page ready
  - WebSocket client ready
  - Premium 2025 design implemented

- **Infrastructure:** Ready
  - Dockerfile optimized (multi-stage build)
  - PM2 ecosystem.config.js configured
  - .dockerignore present
  - Health checks implemented

### üî¥ What's Broken

**PRIMARY ISSUE:** AI Models Missing from Seed
```
Current AI models seed:
- video-generator: 4 models ‚úì
- poster-editor: 3 models ‚úì
- video-mixer: 1 model ‚úì
- carousel-mix: 1 model ‚úì
- looping-flow: 1 model ‚úì
- avatar-creator: 4 models ‚úì
- pose-generator: 0 models ‚ùå

Total: 21 models (should be 24)
```

**Why This Breaks Dashboard:**
- Dashboard filters apps by `AIModel.appId`
- Apps with 0 models are filtered out
- This is intentional for access control
- Result: Pose Generator is hidden from all users

---

## FILES ANALYSIS

### Modified Files (Staged for Commit)
```
‚úÖ backend/src/index.ts
   - Made database connection optional in dev mode
   - Critical for local development without Docker

‚úÖ backend/src/app.ts
   - Added cache control middleware
   - Prevents stale API responses

‚ùå backend/prisma/seeds/ai-models.seed.ts
   - MISSING 3 Pose Generator models
   - BLOCKER: Must add before deployment
```

### New Files (Already Committed)
```
‚úÖ backend/src/apps/pose-generator/
   - Complete implementation (routes, services, workers)
   - schemas/ directory (validation) - untracked but ready

‚úÖ backend/prisma/seeds/
   - pose-generator.seed.ts ‚úì
   - data/pose-categories.ts ‚úì
   - data/pose-library.ts ‚úì

‚úÖ frontend/src/apps/pose-generator/
   - Complete React app (committed in previous commits)
```

## DEPLOYMENT BLOCKERS

### üî¥ BLOCKER #1: Add AI Models to Seed (CRITICAL)

**File:** `backend/prisma/seeds/ai-models.seed.ts`

**Required:** 3 models
1. `flux-controlnet-standard` (30 credits, basic tier)
2. `flux-controlnet-pro` (40 credits, pro tier)
3. `background-changer-sam` (10 credits, basic tier)

**Location:** Insert after line 336 (after avatar-creator models)

**Impact if not fixed:** Pose Generator remains invisible on production

**Time to fix:** 5 minutes (copy-paste code from POSE_GENERATOR_DEPLOY_QUICK_START.md)

---

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

### Critical for Pose Generator
```bash
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY="hf_xxxxx"  # CRITICAL - AI generation fails without this
REDIS_HOST="redis"               # CRITICAL - Queue system requires Redis
REDIS_PORT="6379"                # CRITICAL - Queue system requires Redis
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."  # CRITICAL - App data storage
```

### AI Model Configuration
```bash
FLUX_MODEL="black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev"
SDXL_MODEL="stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0"
```

### Worker Configuration (Optional)
```bash
WORKER_CONCURRENCY="5"
WORKER_NAME="pose-generator-worker-prod"
```

**Verify in Coolify:**
- Navigate: Application ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Ensure ALL variables above are set
- Pay special attention to `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`

## DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Quick Path (15 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Add AI models to seed file (5 min)
code backend/prisma/seeds/ai-models.seed.ts
# ‚Üí See POSE_GENERATOR_DEPLOY_QUICK_START.md for exact code

# 2. Commit and push (2 min)
git add backend/src/index.ts backend/src/app.ts
git add backend/prisma/seeds/ai-models.seed.ts
git add backend/src/apps/pose-generator/schemas/
git commit -m "feat(pose-generator): Add AI models and enable production deployment"
git push origin development

# 3. Wait for Coolify auto-deploy (3-5 min)
# Monitor at: Coolify Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments

# 4. SSH into production (5 min)
ssh user@dev.lumiku.com
cd /path/to/lumiku-app/backend
bun prisma/seed.ts  # Seeds 24 AI models + categories + poses
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production
pm2 save
```

**Verify:**
```bash
# Check Pose Generator is visible
curl https://dev.lumiku.com/api/apps | grep pose-generator

# Login to dashboard
# ‚Üí Pose Generator card should appear (indigo color)
```

---

## WHY POSE GENERATOR WORKS LOCALLY BUT NOT PRODUCTION

**Local Development:**
- No database seed required (development data in seed)
- Plugin always loads (no filter)
- Dashboard shows all registered apps

**Production:**
- Database seed IS required
- Dashboard filters by `AIModel.appId`
- Apps with 0 models = HIDDEN

**The Fix:**
- Add AI models to seed
- Run seed in production
- Dashboard filter now passes
- Pose Generator appears

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Low Risk Deployment ‚úÖ
- Backend code is production-ready (100% complete)
- Frontend code is production-ready (100% complete)
- Database migrations already applied
- Infrastructure configuration tested
- Rollback plan available

### Medium Risk: First Production Deploy ‚ö†Ô∏è
- First time deploying Pose Generator
- New worker process (pose-generator-worker)
- New WebSocket endpoint
- Mitigation: Feature flag available in plugin.config.ts

### Zero Risk If Rollback Needed ‚úÖ
- Coolify one-click rollback
- Feature flag: `features.enabled = false`
- No breaking changes to existing apps

---

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

## TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK REFERENCE

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Pose Generator not visible | 0 AI models in DB | Run `bun prisma/seed.ts` |
| Worker not processing | PM2 not started | `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production` |
| WebSocket not connecting | Redis not configured | Check `REDIS_HOST` in Coolify |
| Generation fails | Missing API key | Set `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` in Coolify |
| Build fails | Prisma client issue | Check Dockerfile line 34 & 80 |
