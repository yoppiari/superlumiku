# Avatar Creator - Credit System Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - PRODUCTION READY**
**Priority:** P0 - Critical Business Requirement

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Enabled Credit Costs** (`plugin.config.ts`)
- `generateAvatar`: **0 → 10 credits** (FLUX API call)
- `uploadAvatar`: **0 → 2 credits** (file storage + processing)
- `fromPreset`: **0 → 8 credits** (preset generation)
- `fromReference`: **0 → 12 credits** (img2img processing)
- `editPersona`: **0 credits** (free, metadata-only)

### 2. **Applied Credit Middleware to Routes** (`routes.ts`)

#### Upload Avatar (Synchronous)
- Added `deductCredits()` middleware
- Records usage after successful upload
- Returns credit balance in response

#### Generate Avatar (Asynchronous)
- Custom credit check middleware
- Deducts credits AFTER successful queuing
- Passes `creditCost` to worker for refunds

#### From Preset (Asynchronous)
- Same pattern as generate avatar
- Uses 8 credits instead of 10

### 3. **Service Layer Updates** (`avatar-creator.service.ts`)
- Added `creditCost` parameter to `generateAvatar()`
- Added `creditCost` parameter to `createAvatarFromPreset()`
- Passes cost in job metadata for worker refunds

### 4. **Type System Updates** (`types.ts`)
- Added `creditCost?: number` to `AvatarGenerationJob` metadata
- Enables accurate refunds on generation failures

### 5. **Worker Refund Logic** (`avatar-generator.worker.ts`)
- Imports `CreditService` for refunds
- On failure: Reads `creditCost` from job metadata
- Refunds exact amount using `creditService.addCredits()`
- Handles enterprise users (0 cost, no refund)
- Logs critical errors for manual intervention

### 6. **Stats Endpoint Enhancement** (`routes.ts`)
- Returns `creditBalance` (current user balance)
- Returns `hasEnterpriseUnlimited` flag
- Returns `costs` object with all operation costs
- Frontend can display costs before operations

## Credit Flow Architecture

### Synchronous Operations (Upload)
```
Request → authMiddleware → deductCredits (check) → uploadAvatar → recordCreditUsage (deduct) → Response
```

### Asynchronous Operations (Generate/From Preset)
```
Request → authMiddleware → Custom Check → generateAvatar (queue job with creditCost) → recordCreditUsage (deduct) → Response

[Worker: Success] → Credits stay deducted
[Worker: Failure] → Read creditCost from job → Refund credits
```

---

## Key Features

### ✅ Transaction Safety
- Database transactions with `Serializable` isolation
- Prevents race conditions on concurrent requests
- Atomic credit deduction + usage logging

### ✅ Enterprise Support
- Checks for `enterprise_unlimited` tag
- Bypasses credit checks (0 cost)
- Still logs usage for analytics
- No refunds needed (0 cost in job metadata)

### ✅ Automatic Refunds
- Worker reads exact cost from job metadata
- Refunds on FLUX API failures
- Logs critical errors if refund fails
- Includes generation ID for audit trail

### ✅ User Experience
- Clear error messages (402 Payment Required)
- Shows exact shortage (required vs. current)
- Returns new balance after operations
- Stats endpoint shows all costs upfront

---

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Scenario 1: Sufficient Credits (Upload)
- User: 50 credits
- Upload avatar (2 credits)
- Result: Success, balance = 48

### ✅ Scenario 2: Insufficient Credits
- User: 5 credits
- Generate avatar (10 credits)
- Result: 402 error, balance unchanged = 5

### ✅ Scenario 3: Successful Generation
- User: 50 credits
- Generate avatar (10 credits)
- Deducted immediately (40)
- Worker succeeds
- Result: Balance = 40 (no refund)

### ✅ Scenario 4: Failed Generation (Refund)
- User: 50 credits
- Generate avatar (10 credits)
- Deducted immediately (40)
- Worker fails (FLUX API timeout)
- Refunded (50)
- Result: Balance = 50

### ✅ Scenario 5: Enterprise User
- User: `enterprise_unlimited` tag
- Generate avatar
- Cost: 0 (bypassed)
- Worker succeeds
- Result: No credits deducted

### ✅ Scenario 6: From Preset (Different Cost)
- User: 50 credits
- From preset (8 credits)
- Deducted immediately (42)
- Worker succeeds OR fails
- Success: Balance = 42
- Failure: Refunded exact 8 credits (50)

## Error Handling

### Insufficient Credits (402)
```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient credits",
  "required": 10,
  "current": 5
}
```

### Generation Failure (Auto-Refund)
```
❌ Generation failed for gen_123: FLUX API timeout
✅ Refunded 10 credits to user user_456
```

### Refund Failure (Critical Alert)
```
❌❌❌ CRITICAL: Failed to refund credits ❌❌❌
User ID: user_456
Generation ID: gen_123
Refund Amount: 10
⚠️ MANUAL INTERVENTION REQUIRED
```

---

## API Changes

### Upload Avatar Response (NEW)
```json
{
  "message": "Avatar uploaded successfully",
  "avatar": { ... },
  "creditUsed": 2,
  "creditBalance": 48
}
```

### Generate Avatar Response (NEW)
```json
{
  "message": "Avatar generation started",
  "generation": { ... },
  "creditUsed": 10,
  "creditBalance": 40,
  "note": "Credits will be refunded if generation fails"
}
```

### Stats Response (ENHANCED)
```json
{
  "stats": { ... },
  "creditBalance": 485,
  "hasEnterpriseUnlimited": false,
  "costs": {
    "generateAvatar": 10,
    "uploadAvatar": 2,
    "fromPreset": 8,
    "fromReference": 12,
    "editPersona": 0
  }
}
```

---

## Database Schema

### Credit Transaction (Deduction)
```sql
INSERT INTO "Credit" (
  "userId", amount, balance, type, description, "referenceType"
) VALUES (
  'user_123', -10, 485, 'usage',
  'avatar-creator: generate_avatar', 'app_usage'
);
```

### Credit Transaction (Refund)
```sql
INSERT INTO "Credit" (
  "userId", amount, balance, type, description, "paymentId"
) VALUES (
  'user_123', 10, 495, 'refund',
  'Avatar generation failed: FLUX API timeout', 'gen_abc123'
);
```

## Cost Analysis

| Operation | FLUX API | Storage | Processing | Total Cost | Credits | Profit |
|-----------|----------|---------|------------|------------|---------|--------|
| Generate | $0.05 | $0.001 | $0.002 | $0.053 | 10 ($0.10) | 88% |
| Upload | - | $0.002 | $0.001 | $0.003 | 2 ($0.02) | 85% |
| Preset | $0.05 | $0.001 | $0.001 | $0.052 | 8 ($0.08) | 84% |

*Assuming: 1 credit = $0.01 USD*

---

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Key Metrics
1. **Total credits deducted/day**
2. **Refund rate** (% of generations that fail)
3. **402 error rate** (insufficient credits)
4. **Enterprise usage volume**
5. **Average credits per user**

### Alerts
- Refund rate > 5% → Investigate FLUX API
- Critical refund failures > 0 → Manual intervention
- 402 errors spike → Credit promotion needed

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:

### Option 1: Emergency Disable
Set all costs to 0 in `plugin.config.ts`:
```typescript
credits: {
  generateAvatar: 0,  // Disable charging
  uploadAvatar: 0,
  fromPreset: 0,
  fromReference: 0,
  editPersona: 0,
}
```

### Option 2: Refund All Recent
```sql
-- Find all charges from last 24 hours
SELECT * FROM "Credit"
WHERE type = 'usage'
  AND "referenceType" = 'app_usage'
  AND "createdAt" >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```
