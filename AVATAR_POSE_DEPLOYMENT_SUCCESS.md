## 📋 NEXT STEPS

### Week 2: Pose Dataset Preparation
**Goal:** Seed database with 500-1000 pose templates

**Tasks:**
1. Get Hugging Face API key
   - URL: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
   - Create "Read" token
   - Add to environment: `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`

2. Download pose dataset from Hugging Face
   - Fashion: 200-300 poses
   - Skincare: 150-200 poses
   - Lifestyle: 150-200 poses

3. Create seed script
   - Parse keypoints JSON
   - Generate preview images
   - Populate `pose_templates` table

4. Verify seeding
   - Check via Prisma Studio
   - Test queries by category
   - Validate keypoints format

### Week 3: Brand Kit Plugin
**Goal:** Build and deploy Brand Kit Manager

**Components:**
1. Backend API (4 endpoints)
   - POST `/api/brand-kits` - Create brand kit
   - GET `/api/brand-kits` - List user's brand kits
   - GET `/api/brand-kits/:id` - Get single brand kit
   - PUT `/api/brand-kits/:id` - Update brand kit
   - DELETE `/api/brand-kits/:id` - Delete brand kit

2. Frontend Plugin
   - Brand kit form (name, logo, colors, fonts)
   - Brand kit list with cards
   - Set default brand
   - Delete confirmation

3. Deploy and Test
   - Push to development branch
   - Deploy via Coolify API
   - Test CRUD operations

### Week 4-9: Remaining Plugins
- Week 4-5: Avatar Manager
- Week 6: Product Manager
- Week 7-9: Pose Generator (CORE!)

---

## 🔧 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

### Required for Week 2:
Add these to Coolify environment variables:

```bash
# Hugging Face API
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY="hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
HUGGINGFACE_MODEL_ID="lllyasviel/control_v11p_sd15_openpose"

# Storage Limits
MAX_AVATAR_SIZE_MB=10
MAX_PRODUCT_SIZE_MB=20
MAX_POSES_PER_GENERATION=500

# Pose Dataset Path
POSE_DATASET_PATH="./storage/pose-dataset"
```

**How to Add via Coolify:**
1. Go to: https://cf.avolut.com
2. Navigate to: Project > Environment > Application Settings
3. Add environment variables
4. Redeploy application

---

## 📊 DATABASE SCHEMA VERIFICATION

### To Verify Tables Were Created:

**Option 1: Via Prisma Studio (Local)**
```bash
cd backend
bun prisma studio
```
Then check for 9 new tables in the database browser.

**Option 2: Via psql (Server)**
```bash
# SSH to server (if needed)
# Then run:
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\dt" | grep -E "brand_kits|avatars|products|pose_"
```

**Option 3: Via API Query (After Week 3)**
Once Brand Kit plugin is built, you can test CRUD operations to verify database is working.
