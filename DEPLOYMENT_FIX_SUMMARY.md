# Deployment Fix Summary - Quick Reference

## Status: DEPLOYMENT BUILDING (IN PROGRESS)

**Deployment UUID**: l800go4wwsogswswoko4oskc
**Triggered**: Successfully via API
**Force Rebuild**: Enabled

---

## CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED

You must update 2 environment variables in Coolify UI **BEFORE** this deployment can succeed.

### Go to Coolify UI
https://cf.avolut.com → Applications → dev-superlumiku → Environment Variables

### Update These 2 Variables

#### 1. DATABASE_URL

**OLD**:
```
postgres://postgres:6LP0Ojegy7IUU6kaX9lLkmZRUiAdAUNOltWyL3LegfYGR6rPQtB4DUSVqjdA78ES@107.155.75.50:5986/lumiku-dev
```

**NEW**:
```
postgresql://postgres:6LP0Ojegy7IUU6kaX9lLkmZRUiAdAUNOltWyL3LegfYGR6rPQtB4DUSVqjdA78ES@ycwc4s4ookos40k44gc8oooc:5432/lumiku-dev
```

#### 2. POSTGRES_HOST

**OLD**: `107.155.75.50`
**NEW**: `ycwc4s4ookos40k44gc8oooc`

### Click "SAVE" in Coolify UI

---

## Why This Fix Works

**Problem**: App is trying to connect to PostgreSQL using external IP address (`107.155.75.50:5986`)

**Solution**: Use internal Docker hostname (`ycwc4s4ookos40k44gc8oooc:5432`)

**Result**:
- Database connection succeeds
- Migrations run successfully
- Application starts without errors

---

## After Updating Env Vars

### Option 1: Wait for Current Deployment
Current deployment will fail (because env vars not updated yet), then trigger new deployment.

### Option 2: Stop and Redeploy Now
1. Stop current deployment in Coolify
2. Trigger new deployment (I can do this via API)

---

## Post-Deployment Commands (Run in Coolify Terminal)

After deployment completes, run these commands:

```bash
# Fix migration state
cd backend && bunx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20251014_add_avatar_creator_complete

# Verify migrations
bunx prisma migrate status

# Test database connection
bunx prisma db pull

# Test application
curl https://dev.lumiku.com/api/health
```

---

## What Was Automated via API

- Environment variable analysis
- Database hostname discovery
- Force rebuild deployment triggered
- Deployment monitoring

## What Requires Manual Steps

- Environment variable updates (API key has read-only permissions)
- Migration state resolution (requires terminal access)
- Deployment verification

## Ready to Proceed?

Let me know once you've updated the environment variables in Coolify UI, and I'll:
1. Trigger a new deployment via API (if needed)
2. Monitor deployment progress
3. Help with post-deployment verification

**Important**: The current deployment will likely fail because the environment variables haven't been updated yet. This is expected. Once you update the env vars, we'll trigger a fresh deployment that should succeed.
