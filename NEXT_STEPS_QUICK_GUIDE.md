## 🚀 What You Need to Do NOW (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Execute Database Migration

**Option A: Via Coolify UI (EASIEST!)**

1. Open: https://cf.avolut.com
2. Login
3. Go to: Database → PostgreSQL → Terminal (or Execute SQL)
4. Open file: `AVATAR_PROJECT_MIGRATION_SQL.sql` (already opened)
5. Copy ALL (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
6. Paste in Coolify SQL terminal
7. Click "Execute" or "Run"
8. Wait for success messages

**Expected Output:**
```
Processing user: user_xxx (N avatars)
Created project: proj_xxx
Migrated N avatars to project
...
✅ All avatars have been migrated!
avatars_without_project: 0
```

**Option B: Via SSH**
```bash
ssh root@your-coolify-server
docker exec -it coolify-db psql -U postgres -d lumiku
# Then paste SQL content
```

### Step 2: Apply Constraints (After Step 1 Success)

If Step 1 shows `avatars_without_project: 0`:

1. In SQL file, uncomment these lines (around line 126):
```sql
ALTER TABLE "avatars" ALTER COLUMN "project_id" SET NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE "avatars"
ADD CONSTRAINT "fk_avatars_project"
FOREIGN KEY ("project_id")
REFERENCES "avatar_projects"("id")
ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

2. Execute them in Coolify SQL terminal

---

### Step 3: Test (2 minutes)

**Backend API:**
```bash
curl https://app.lumiku.com/api/apps/avatar-creator/projects
# Should return: { "projects": [...] }
```

**Frontend:**
1. Visit: https://app.lumiku.com
2. Login
3. Go to: Dashboard → Avatar Creator
4. **You should see:** Projects list (NOT flat avatars)
5. Click "New Project"
6. Try uploading an avatar
7. Try generating AI avatar

**Common issues:**
- "Table exists" → OK, skip to Step 3 (data migration)
- "Column exists" → OK, skip to Step 3 (data migration)
- "Some NULL project_id" → Re-run Step 3 DO block
- Foreign key error → Don't apply constraints yet, fix NULLs first
