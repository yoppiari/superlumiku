# Executive Summary: "npx: not found" Error Fix

## Problem

User tried to run `npx prisma migrate deploy` in Coolify production terminal and received error:
```
sh: npx: not found
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why NPX Doesn't Exist

The production container is built from `oven/bun:1-alpine` Docker image, which:
- Uses **Bun** as the JavaScript runtime (NOT Node.js)
- Does NOT include npm or npx
- Only includes Bun and its equivalent tool: bunx

### Evidence from Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Line 58-70 in main Dockerfile
FROM oven/bun:1-alpine AS production
```

This base image provides:
- ✅ Bun runtime
- ✅ bunx (Bun's npx equivalent)
- ❌ Node.js (not installed)
- ❌ npm (not installed)
- ❌ npx (not installed)

## Solution

### Immediate Fix (Copy-Paste This)

```bash
cd /app/backend
bunx prisma migrate deploy
```

**That's it!** Replace `npx` with `bunx`.

## Command Translation Guide

| NPM/Node.js Command | Bun Equivalent |
|---------------------|----------------|
| `npx prisma migrate deploy` | `bunx prisma migrate deploy` |
| `npx prisma migrate status` | `bunx prisma migrate status` |
| `npx prisma generate` | `bunx prisma generate` |
| `npm install` | `bun install` |
| `npm run dev` | `bun run dev` |
| `node script.js` | `bun script.js` |

## Alternative Solutions

If `bunx` doesn't work for some reason:

### Option 1: Direct Prisma Binary
```bash
cd /app/backend
./node_modules/.bin/prisma migrate deploy
```

### Option 2: Use Package Script
```bash
cd /app/backend
bun run prisma:migrate:deploy
```

### Option 3: Plain Bun
```bash
cd /app/backend
bun prisma migrate deploy
```

## Verification Steps

After running migration:

```bash
# Check migration status
bunx prisma migrate status

# Expected output:
# "All migrations have been successfully applied."
```

## Why Bun Instead of Node.js?

Advantages of Bun runtime:
1. **Faster startup time** - Bun starts ~3x faster than Node.js
2. **Lower memory usage** - Better for containerized environments
3. **Built-in TypeScript** - No need for ts-node or compilation
4. **Better performance** - Native code execution
5. **Smaller image size** - Alpine-based Bun image is minimal

## Complete Migration Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Navigate to backend
cd /app/backend

# Step 2: Deploy migrations
bunx prisma migrate deploy

# Step 3: Check migration status
bunx prisma migrate status

# Step 4: Seed database (optional)
bun run prisma:seed

# Step 5: Verify database
bunx prisma db pull
```

## Key Takeaways

- ✅ Production uses Bun runtime, not Node.js
- ✅ Replace `npx` with `bunx` in all commands
- ✅ Prisma is installed and available via bunx
- ✅ All package.json scripts work with `bun run`
- ❌ Never try to install npm/npx in production container
- ❌ Don't rebuild image just to use npm

## Support Commands

```bash
# Check Bun version
bun --version

# List all available scripts
cat package.json | grep -A 30 scripts

# Test database connection
bunx prisma migrate status

# View migration history
bunx prisma migrate status --schema=prisma/schema.prisma
```

## Success Criteria

✅ User can run: `bunx prisma migrate deploy`
✅ Migrations complete successfully
✅ Database schema is up to date
✅ Application runs without errors
✅ User understands Bun vs Node.js difference

## Next Steps

1. Update documentation to use `bunx` instead of `npx`
2. Update deployment scripts to use Bun commands
3. Train team on Bun runtime differences
4. Consider adding this to onboarding docs

## Contact

If issues persist:
- Check Bun documentation: https://bun.sh/docs
- Check Prisma with Bun: https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/under-the-hood/engines
- Review Dockerfile configuration
- Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable

---

**TL;DR**: Replace `npx` with `bunx`. That's the entire fix.
