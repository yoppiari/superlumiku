**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: PRODUCTION BLOCKED - P0 SECURITY ISSUES FIXED IN CODE, MANUAL ACTIONS REQUIRED
**Estimated Time to Complete**: 30 minutes

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Automated Fixes)

The following security issues have been **automatically fixed in the codebase**:

1. **‚úÖ Hardcoded passwords removed** from `backend/src/routes/admin.routes.ts`
   - Insecure password update endpoint completely removed
   - Security comment added to prevent future mistakes

2. **‚úÖ Exposed HuggingFace API key removed** from `backend/.env`
   - Key replaced with placeholder
   - Security comment added with key generation instructions

3. **‚úÖ .gitignore enhanced** to prevent future credential commits
   - Explicit backend/.env and frontend/.env patterns added
   - Warning comment added

---

## üî¥ IMMEDIATE MANUAL ACTIONS REQUIRED

You MUST complete these actions NOW before any deployment:

### Action 1: Reset All Compromised User Passwords (P0 - CRITICAL)

**Affected Users** (passwords exposed in git history):
1. ardianfaisal.id@gmail.com
2. iqbal.elvo@gmail.com
3. galuh.inteko@gmail.com
4. dilla.inteko@gmail.com

**How to Reset**:

```bash
# Connect to your production database
# Option A: Using Prisma Studio
npx prisma studio

# Option B: Using Coolify dashboard
# 1. Go to Coolify dashboard
# 2. Navigate to your database service
# 3. Open database terminal

# Option C: Direct PostgreSQL connection
psql "postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"

# Then for EACH user, run:
UPDATE "User"
SET password = '$2a$10$[NEW_BCRYPT_HASH_HERE]'
WHERE email = 'user@email.com';
```

**OR use the password reset flow** (recommended):
1. Implement a secure admin password reset tool
2. Generate secure random passwords for each user
3. Send password reset emails to users
4. Force password change on next login

**NEW SECURE PASSWORDS**:
- Minimum 16 characters
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Use a password generator (e.g., `openssl rand -base64 24`)

**Example password generation**:
```bash
# Generate 4 secure passwords
for i in {1..4}; do openssl rand -base64 24; done
```

---

### Action 2: Revoke and Replace HuggingFace API Key (P0 - CRITICAL)

**Exposed Key**: `hf_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

**Steps**:

1. **IMMEDIATELY revoke the exposed key**:
   - Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
   - Find token `hf_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
   - Click "Revoke" or "Delete"

2. **Generate a new API key**:
   - Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
   - Click "New token"
   - Name: `lumiku-production-2025-10`
   - Type: Read
   - Click "Generate"
   - **COPY THE KEY IMMEDIATELY** (you can't see it again)

3. **Update your .env file**:
   ```bash
   # Edit backend/.env
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY="hf_YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE"
   ```

4. **Update Coolify environment variables**:
   - Go to Coolify dashboard
   - Navigate to your application
   - Environment Variables section
   - Update `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` with new value
   - Redeploy the application

5. **Verify the old key is revoked**:
   ```bash
   # Test that old key no longer works (should fail)
   curl https://huggingface.co/api/models \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer hf_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
   # Expected: 401 Unauthorized
   ```

---

### Action 3: Review Duitku Sandbox Credentials (P2 - MEDIUM)

**Exposed Credentials** (sandbox only, lower risk):
```
DUITKU_MERCHANT_CODE="DS25180"
DUITKU_API_KEY="55e33f1d71cc5ed5ce8b5abab54fc7ae"
```

**Actions**:
1. These are sandbox credentials (development only)
2. Verify these are NOT production credentials
3. If production, contact Duitku support to reset
4. Ensure production credentials are ONLY in Coolify environment variables

---

## üìã POST-FIX VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After completing all manual actions, verify:

- [ ] All 4 user passwords have been reset and users notified
- [ ] Old HuggingFace API key is revoked (returns 401)
- [ ] New HuggingFace API key is working (test inference API)
- [ ] Coolify environment variables updated with new key
- [ ] Application deployed with new environment variables
- [ ] Application starts successfully (check logs)
- [ ] Avatar generation still works (test with new key)
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets remain in codebase (run security audit)
- [ ] .env files are in .gitignore (verify with `git status`)

---

## üîí SECURITY BEST PRACTICES GOING FORWARD

### 1. Never Commit Secrets

**NEVER commit these to git**:
- API keys
- Passwords
- JWT secrets
- Database credentials
- OAuth client secrets
- Private keys

**Always use**:
- Environment variables
- Secrets management (Coolify, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- .env files (in .gitignore)

### 2. Use Pre-Commit Hooks

Install git-secrets or gitleaks:

```bash
# Install gitleaks
brew install gitleaks  # macOS
choco install gitleaks # Windows

# Scan repository
gitleaks detect --source . --verbose

# Add pre-commit hook
# Create .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/sh
gitleaks protect --verbose --staged
```

### 3. Regular Security Audits

```bash
# Scan for secrets in git history
gitleaks detect --source . --log-opts="--all"

# Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
npm audit
bun audit

# Check for outdated packages with known CVEs
npm outdated
```

### 4. Password Management

**For user passwords**:
- Minimum 12 characters (16+ recommended)
- Enforce complexity requirements
- Use bcrypt with cost factor ‚â• 10
- Implement password reset flows
- Never store passwords in plain text
- Never log passwords
- Never return passwords in API responses

**For service credentials (JWT secrets, API keys)**:
- Minimum 32 characters (64+ recommended)
- High entropy (use crypto random generators)
- Rotate regularly (quarterly for production)
- Different secrets per environment
- Monitor for exposure (GitHub secret scanning)

### 5. API Key Security

- Use read-only permissions when possible
- Set IP restrictions if supported
- Monitor usage for anomalies
- Rotate keys regularly
- Revoke keys immediately if exposed
- Never log API keys
- Never return keys in API responses

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

Before deploying to production:

1. **Environment Variables Audit**:
   ```bash
   # List all environment variables in Coolify
   # Ensure no secrets are hardcoded in source
   grep -r "api.key\|password\|secret" backend/src/ --exclude-dir=node_modules
   ```

2. **Security Scan**:
   ```bash
   # Run security audit
   npm audit
   gitleaks detect --source . --verbose
   ```

3. **Configuration Review**:
   - [ ] JWT_SECRET is 64+ characters, high entropy
   - [ ] All API keys are current and not revoked
   - [ ] Database credentials are secure
   - [ ] CORS origins are restricted
   - [ ] Rate limiting is enabled
   - [ ] Production mode is enabled (`NODE_ENV=production`)

4. **Testing**:
   - [ ] Authentication works
   - [ ] API key integrations work (HuggingFace, Duitku)
   - [ ] User login works
   - [ ] Password reset works
   - [ ] No secrets in logs

5. **Monitoring**:
   - [ ] Set up alerts for authentication failures
   - [ ] Monitor API usage (HuggingFace credits)
   - [ ] Log security events
   - [ ] Set up intrusion detection
