## Critical Errors Detected

### 🔴 Error 1: PostgreSQL Connection Refused (CRITICAL)

```
psql: error: connection to server at "107.155.75.50", port 5432 failed: Connection refused
PostgreSQL is unavailable - sleeping (attempt 1/30)
```

**Impact**: Application cannot start
**Priority**: P0 - BLOCKING
**Fix Required**: Manual intervention in Coolify

**Root Cause**:
- PostgreSQL service not running, OR
- DATABASE_URL pointing to wrong host/port, OR
- Firewall blocking connection

**Solution**: See Section "Fix 1" below

---

### 🟡 Error 2: Missing Module (FALSE ALARM)

```
error: Cannot find module './apps/pose-generator/websocket/pose-websocket'
```

**Impact**: None - File exists in repository
**Priority**: P2 - Monitor
**Fix Required**: Clear build cache

**Root Cause**:
- Docker build cache showing stale error
- File exists at: `backend/src/apps/pose-generator/websocket/pose-websocket.ts`
- Properly exported with all required functions

**Solution**: Force rebuild without cache

---

### 🟡 Error 3: Migration State Mismatch (RECOVERABLE)

```
migrate found failed migrations in the target database
The `20251014_add_avatar_creator_complete` migration failed
```

**Impact**: Future migrations won't run
**Priority**: P1 - Must fix
**Fix Required**: Mark migration as resolved

**Root Cause**:
- Migration marked as failed in `_prisma_migrations` table
- BUT tables were actually created successfully
- State mismatch between Prisma and database

**Solution**: Mark migration as resolved

## Fix 1: PostgreSQL Connection (CRITICAL)

### Diagnosis

**Test database connection:**

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT version();"
```

**If this fails**, the issue is one of:

1. **PostgreSQL service not running**
   - Check: `docker ps | grep postgres`
   - Fix: Restart PostgreSQL service in Coolify

2. **Wrong DATABASE_URL**
   - Check: `echo $DATABASE_URL`
   - Common issue: Using external IP (107.155.75.50) instead of internal Docker hostname
   - Fix: Update to internal hostname (e.g., `coolify-postgres`)

3. **Firewall blocking port 5432**
   - Check: `telnet 107.155.75.50 5432`
   - Fix: Allow port 5432 in firewall rules

4. **Wrong credentials**
   - Check: Verify username/password in DATABASE_URL
   - Fix: Update with correct credentials

### Fix Steps

**Option A: Update DATABASE_URL (Most Common)**

1. Go to: Coolify → Application → Environment Variables
2. Find: `DATABASE_URL`
3. Current (likely wrong): `postgresql://user:pass@107.155.75.50:5432/db`
4. Change to: `postgresql://user:pass@INTERNAL_HOSTNAME:5432/db`
5. Example: `postgresql://lumiku:password@coolify-postgres:5432/lumiku_db?schema=public`
6. Save and redeploy

**Option B: Restart PostgreSQL Service**

1. Go to: Coolify → Services → PostgreSQL
2. Click: **Restart**
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Test connection again

**Option C: Check PostgreSQL Logs**

1. Go to: Coolify → Services → PostgreSQL → Logs
2. Look for error messages
3. Address specific errors (e.g., permission issues, disk space)

### Verification

```bash
# Should return PostgreSQL version
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT version();"

# Should return 1
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1;"
```

---

## Fix 2: Migration State Mismatch

### Diagnosis

**Check migration status:**

```bash
cd /app
bunx prisma migrate status
```

**If shows failed migrations**, verify tables exist:

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\dt" | grep avatar
```

**If tables exist**, migration actually succeeded - just state is wrong.

### Fix Steps

**Option A: Mark Migration as Resolved (Recommended)**

```bash
cd /app
bunx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20251014_add_avatar_creator_complete
bunx prisma migrate status
```

**Option B: Manual Database Update**

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL <<EOF
UPDATE "_prisma_migrations"
SET finished_at = NOW(),
    success = true,
    rolled_back_at = NULL,
    logs = 'Manually resolved - tables exist and are functional'
WHERE migration_name = '20251014_add_avatar_creator_complete';
EOF
```

**Option C: Delete and Rerun (Only if tables don't exist)**

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "DELETE FROM _prisma_migrations WHERE migration_name = '20251014_add_avatar_creator_complete';"
bunx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Verification

```bash
# Should show "No pending migrations"
bunx prisma migrate status

# Verify tables exist
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM avatar_projects;"
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pose_categories;"
```

## Root Cause Summary

### Why Deployment Failed

1. **PostgreSQL Connection Issue**
   - DATABASE_URL likely using external IP instead of internal Docker hostname
   - Coolify internal networking requires Docker service names
   - External IP (107.155.75.50) not accessible from backend container

2. **Migration State Mismatch**
   - Migration ran but timed out or encountered transient error
   - Tables were created successfully
   - Prisma marked migration as failed despite success
   - State inconsistency prevents future migrations

3. **Module Resolution (False Alarm)**
   - File exists in repository
   - Docker build cache showing stale error
   - Force rebuild will resolve

### Prevention for Future

1. **Database Connection**
   - Always use internal Docker service names in DATABASE_URL
   - Document correct format in .env.example
   - Add database connection test in CI/CD

2. **Migration Handling**
   - Monitor migration execution time
   - Set longer timeout for complex migrations
   - Verify migration success before marking complete
   - Add migration rollback procedure

3. **Build Process**
   - Clear build cache on major changes
   - Add smoke tests after build
   - Verify all modules resolve before deployment

## Code Review Findings

### What's Working ✅

- **Source Code**: All files exist and are properly structured
- **TypeScript**: No compilation errors (local build succeeds)
- **Prisma Schema**: Correctly defined with all tables
- **Migration Files**: Complete and correct SQL
- **Docker Configuration**: Multi-stage build properly configured
- **Environment Validation**: Zod validation in place

### What Needs Fixing ⚠️

- **DATABASE_URL**: Needs internal hostname, not external IP
- **Migration State**: Needs manual resolution
- **Build Cache**: Needs clearing for clean build

### No Code Changes Required ✅

All issues are infrastructure/configuration related:
- No bugs in application code
- No missing files
- No broken imports
- No TypeScript errors

---
