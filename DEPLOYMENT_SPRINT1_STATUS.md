**Deployment Date**: 2025-10-14
**Branch**: `development`
**Commit**: `b1a42a2`
**Status**: üöÄ **PUSHED - Awaiting Coolify Deployment**

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist - COMPLETED

### 1. Code Changes Verified ‚úÖ
All Sprint 1 security implementations are in place:
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting middleware enhanced
- ‚úÖ File validation utility created
- ‚úÖ Zod validation schemas created
- ‚úÖ Validation middleware created
- ‚úÖ Routes updated with security layers
- ‚úÖ Service updated with validation
- ‚úÖ Worker updated with refund logic
- ‚úÖ Plugin config updated (credits enabled)
- ‚úÖ Types updated (creditCost, isEnterprise)

### 2. Dependencies Verified ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ `file-type@21.0.0` - installed
- ‚úÖ `zod@3.25.76` - installed (upgraded from 3.22.4)
- ‚úÖ `sharp@0.34.4` - installed

### 3. Environment Variables ‚úÖ
Required environment variables for Sprint 1 features:

```bash
# Database (Required)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

## üìä Post-Deployment Verification

Once deployment completes, verify the following:

### Step 3: Health Check

```bash
# Basic health check
curl https://dev.lumiku.com/api/health

# Avatar Creator health check
curl https://dev.lumiku.com/api/apps/avatar-creator/health
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "app": "avatar-creator",
  "message": "Avatar Creator API is running (Phase 2-5 - Full Implementation + Presets)",
  "endpoints": {
    "projects": "GET, POST /projects",
    "project": "GET, PUT, DELETE /projects/:id",
    "upload": "POST /projects/:projectId/avatars/upload",
    "generate": "POST /projects/:projectId/avatars/generate",
    "fromPreset": "POST /projects/:projectId/avatars/from-preset",
    "generation": "GET /generations/:id",
    "avatar": "GET, PUT, DELETE /avatars/:id",
    "presets": "GET /presets (optional ?category=)",
    "preset": "GET /presets/:id",
    "usage": "GET /avatars/:id/usage-history",
    "stats": "GET /stats"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Smoke Tests

#### Test 1: Rate Limiting (NEW)

```bash
# Set your JWT token
export TOKEN="your_jwt_token_here"
export PROJECT_ID="your_project_id_here"

# Test rate limit - 6th request should return 429
for i in {1..6}; do
  echo "Request $i:"
  curl -X POST "https://dev.lumiku.com/api/apps/avatar-creator/projects/$PROJECT_ID/avatars/generate" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"name": "Test", "prompt": "professional Indonesian woman"}' \
    -w "\nHTTP %{http_code}\n\n"
  sleep 1
done
```

**Expected Result**:
- Requests 1-5: HTTP 200 (or 402 if insufficient credits)
- Request 6: HTTP 429 with message "Too many avatar generation requests"

#### Test 2: File Upload Security (NEW)

```bash
# Test with valid image (should work)
curl -X POST "https://dev.lumiku.com/api/apps/avatar-creator/projects/$PROJECT_ID/avatars/upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "image=@test-image.jpg" \
  -F "name=Test Avatar" \
  -F "gender=female" \
  -F "ageRange=adult" \
  -w "\nHTTP %{http_code}\n"
```

**Expected Result**: HTTP 200 with avatar data

**Security Test** (optional - test with malicious file):
```bash
# Create fake image file (should fail validation)
echo "<?php system(\$_GET['cmd']); ?>" > malicious.jpg

curl -X POST "https://dev.lumiku.com/api/apps/avatar-creator/projects/$PROJECT_ID/avatars/upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "image=@malicious.jpg" \
  -F "name=Test"
```

**Expected Result**: HTTP 400 with error "Invalid image format" or "Could not determine file type"

#### Test 3: Input Validation (NEW)

```bash
# Test missing required field
curl -X POST "https://dev.lumiku.com/api/apps/avatar-creator/projects" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}' \
  -w "\nHTTP %{http_code}\n"
```

**Expected Result**: HTTP 400 with clear validation error

```bash
# Test valid request
curl -X POST "https://dev.lumiku.com/api/apps/avatar-creator/projects" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "My Test Project", "description": "Testing validation"}' \
  -w "\nHTTP %{http_code}\n"
```

**Expected Result**: HTTP 200 with project data

#### Test 4: Credit System (NEW)

```bash
# Check credit costs
curl "https://dev.lumiku.com/api/apps/avatar-creator/stats" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "stats": { ... },
  "creditBalance": 100,
  "hasEnterpriseUnlimited": false,
  "costs": {
    "generateAvatar": 10,
    "uploadAvatar": 2,
    "fromPreset": 8,
    "fromReference": 12,
    "editPersona": 0
  }
}
```

```bash
# Test generation with credit deduction
curl -X POST "https://dev.lumiku.com/api/apps/avatar-creator/projects/$PROJECT_ID/avatars/generate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "AI Avatar",
    "prompt": "Professional Indonesian woman with modern hijab, business attire, confident smile, office background",
    "gender": "female",
    "ageRange": "adult",
    "width": 1024,
    "height": 1024
  }'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Avatar generation started",
  "generation": {
    "id": "gen_xxx",
    "status": "pending",
    "prompt": "...",
    "createdAt": "..."
  },
  "creditUsed": 10,
  "creditBalance": 90,
  "note": "Generation is processing in background. Check status using generation ID. Credits will be refunded if generation fails."
}
```

## üîç Monitoring Post-Deployment

### Application Logs

Check logs in Coolify dashboard for:

1. **Rate Limiting Activity**:
   ```
   [RATE_LIMIT_VIOLATION] 2025-10-14T... - IP: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, Endpoint: /api/apps/avatar-creator/projects/xxx/avatars/generate, Attempts: 6/5
   ```

2. **File Validation**:
   ```
   [FILE_SECURITY_VIOLATION] 2025-10-14T... - MIME_SPOOFING_DETECTED
   ```

3. **Credit Refunds** (if generation fails):
   ```
   ‚úÖ Refunded 10 credits to user xxx for failed generation xxx
   ```

4. **Error Handling**:
   ```
   [ERROR] ValidationError: Prompt too short. Minimum 10 characters for quality results
   ```

### Metrics to Monitor

1. **Error Rate**:
   - 4xx errors: Should be validation errors only
   - 5xx errors: Should be minimal

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - 429 responses: Track abuse attempts
   - Should see logs for violations

3. **Credit Transactions**:
   - Monitor deductions (should be 10 per generation)
   - Monitor refunds (should only happen on failures)

4. **Generation Success Rate**:
   - Monitor FLUX API success/failure
   - Check auto-refund functionality

5. **Performance**:
   - API response times
   - Generation times (30-60s expected for FLUX)

### Set Up Alerts (Recommended)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è 5xx error rate > 1%
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Credit refund rate > 10%
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limit violations > 100/hour
- ‚ö†Ô∏è FLUX API failure rate > 5%

## üêõ Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue 1: Rate Limiting Not Working

**Symptoms**: Users can make unlimited requests

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check Redis connection
redis-cli -h <redis-host> -p <redis-port> ping
# Should return: PONG

# Check Redis keys
redis-cli -h <redis-host> -p <redis-port> KEYS "rl:avatar-creator:*"
```

**Solution**:
- Verify `REDIS_URL` environment variable is set
- Verify Redis is accessible from backend
- Check logs for "Redis not enabled" warnings
- Restart backend if Redis was just enabled

### Issue 2: File Upload Failing

**Symptoms**: All file uploads return 400 errors

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check backend logs for file-type errors
# Look for: "Failed to detect file type"
```

**Solution**:
- Verify `file-type` package is installed
- Check file size limits (default 10MB)
- Verify sharp is working: `bun run -e "console.log(require('sharp'))"`

### Issue 3: Validation Errors

**Symptoms**: Requests failing with validation errors

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check error response format
curl -X POST "..." | jq '.error'
```

**Solution**:
- Verify Zod schemas are loaded
- Check request payload matches schema
- Verify Content-Type header is correct

### Issue 4: Credits Not Being Deducted

**Symptoms**: Credits not decreasing after operations

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check credit balance before and after
curl "https://dev.lumiku.com/api/apps/avatar-creator/stats" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Solution**:
- Verify database connection
- Check `plugin.config.ts` has credits enabled
- Check logs for "Credit deduction" messages
- Verify user is not enterprise_unlimited

### Issue 5: Deployment Build Fails

**Symptoms**: Coolify deployment fails during build

**Common Causes**:
1. **Frontend TypeScript errors**: Fixed by `"strict": false` in tsconfig
2. **Missing dependencies**: Run `bun install` in backend
3. **Prisma generation fails**: Check DATABASE_URL is set

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check Coolify build logs for specific error
# Look for:
# - "npm run build" exit code
# - "bun install" errors
# - "prisma generate" errors
```

## üìù Rollback Plan

If critical issues are found:

### Quick Rollback via Coolify

1. Open Coolify dashboard
2. Navigate to Avatar Creator app
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Find previous successful deployment (before b1a42a2)
5. Click "Redeploy"

### Git Rollback (if needed)

```bash
# Revert commit
git revert b1a42a2

# Push revert
git push origin development
```

### Partial Rollback (disable features)

If only one feature is problematic:

1. **Disable rate limiting**:
   - Comment out rate limiter middleware in routes
   - Redeploy

2. **Disable file validation**:
   - Use basic file checks instead of magic byte validation
   - Redeploy

3. **Disable Zod validation**:
   - Comment out validateBody/validateFormData middleware
   - Redeploy
