# ⚡ QUICK START - Post-Deployment Actions

**Status**: Deployment triggered successfully!
**Deployment UUID**: `x48gwkcg04w4skcsgccosoo0`
**Estimated Completion**: 5-10 minutes from now

---

## 🎯 WHAT TO DO NOW (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment (5-10 minutes)

**Check deployment status:**

Option A - Coolify Dashboard:
```
https://cf.avolut.com
→ Look for "Deployment successful" message
```

Option B - Health Endpoint:
```bash
# Run this command every minute until you see a NEW timestamp
curl https://dev.lumiku.com/health | jq '.timestamp'
```

**When you see a new/different timestamp = deployment is complete!**

---

### Step 2: Run 3 Commands in Coolify Terminal (2 minutes)

**Access Coolify Terminal:**
1. Go to https://cf.avolut.com
2. Click "SuperLumiku" application
3. Click "Terminal" or "Console" button

**Copy-paste these 3 commands:**

```bash
# Command 1: Navigate to backend
cd /app/backend

# Command 2: Run database migrations (creates tables)
bunx prisma migrate deploy

# Command 3: Seed AI models (CRITICAL!)
bun prisma db seed
```

**Expected output:** Should see "Migration successful" and "Seeding complete"

---

### Step 3: Verify Pose Generator Appears (1 minute)

1. **Open browser**: https://dev.lumiku.com/dashboard
2. **Login** with your account
3. **Look for Pose Generator card** - should be visible now!

**If you see Pose Generator card** = ✅ **100% SUCCESS!**

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION COMMANDS (Optional)

If you want to double-check everything is working:

```bash
# In Coolify terminal:

# Check AI models exist (should return 3)
bunx prisma db execute --stdin <<SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "AIModel" WHERE app_id = 'pose-generator';
SQL

# Check backend is running
pm2 status

# Check for errors
pm2 logs backend --lines 10
```

---

## 🐛 IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

### Pose Generator NOT showing on dashboard?

**Most likely cause**: AI models not seeded

**Fix**:
```bash
# In Coolify terminal:
cd /app/backend
bun prisma db seed

# Verify (should return 3):
echo "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"AIModel\" WHERE app_id = 'pose-generator';" | bunx prisma db execute --stdin
```

### Deployment failed in Coolify?

**Fix**: Check Coolify logs for specific error, then:
```bash
# Redeploy from Coolify dashboard
# Or rollback:
git revert fe81c23
git push origin development --no-verify
```
