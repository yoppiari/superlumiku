# 🔴 START HERE: Avatar Creator 500 Error Fix

**Issue**: User getting 500 error when trying to generate avatar
**Root Cause**: ✅ IDENTIFIED - Missing AI models in database
**Fix Time**: ⏱️ 2 minutes
**Priority**: 🔴 P0 Critical (blocks core feature)

---

## 🎯 Quick Summary

After force-deleting the "Professional Muda" project, Avatar Creator stopped working.

**The problem is NOT**:
- ❌ Environment variables (✅ all correctly configured)
- ❌ Code bugs (✅ code is working fine)
- ❌ Project deletion side-effects (✅ project deletion is isolated)

**The problem IS**:
- ✅ Missing AI models in the `AIModel` database table
- When user tries to generate avatar → backend queries for models → finds 0 → throws error → returns 500

---

## 📋 How Avatar Generation Works

```
User clicks "Generate Avatar"
    ↓
Frontend sends: POST /api/apps/avatar-creator/projects/[id]/avatars/generate
    ↓
Backend receives request
    ↓
Backend queries database:
    SELECT * FROM AIModel WHERE appId = 'avatar-creator' AND enabled = true
    ↓
  If models.length === 0:
    ✗ Throw error: "No AI models available for Avatar Creator"
    → API returns 500
    ↓
  If models.length > 0:
    ✓ Select best model based on user tier
    ✓ Queue generation job with HuggingFace
    ✓ Return 200 with generation ID
```

**Current State**: Step 3 returns 0 models → Error 500

## 🚀 The Fix (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Option 1: Copy-Paste SQL (Fastest - 1 minute)

**Open**: `COPY_PASTE_FIX_NOW.txt`
**Execute**: Commands on Coolify terminal or production SSH
**Result**: 4 AI models inserted in database

### Option 2: Run Full Diagnostic (Recommended - 2 minutes)

**Open**: `check-avatar-models.sh`
**Execute**: `bash check-avatar-models.sh`
**Result**: Full diagnosis + automatic fix suggestions

### Option 3: Use Prisma Seed (Comprehensive)

```bash
# On production server
cd /app/backend
bun run prisma db seed
```

---

## ✅ Expected Result

After running the fix, database should have:

| Model Key | Name | Tier | Cost | Provider |
|-----------|------|------|------|----------|
| `avatar-creator:flux-dev-base` | FLUX.1-dev Base | free | 8 | huggingface |
| `avatar-creator:flux-dev-realism` | FLUX.1-dev + Realism LoRA | basic | 12 | huggingface |
| `avatar-creator:flux-dev-hd-realism` | FLUX.1-dev HD + Realism | pro | 15 | huggingface |
| `avatar-creator:flux-schnell-fast` | FLUX.1-schnell Fast | basic | 6 | huggingface |

**All models** should have `enabled = true`.

---

## 🧪 Test After Fix

### Test 1: Check Database
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "AIModel" WHERE "appId" = 'avatar-creator' AND enabled = true;
-- Should return: 4
```

### Test 2: Generate Avatar via UI
1. Go to https://dev.lumiku.com
2. Navigate to Avatar Creator
3. Click "Generate Avatar"
4. Enter prompt: "professional headshot, business attire"
5. Click Generate

**Expected**:
- ✅ Generation starts
- ✅ Shows "Generation is processing"
- ✅ Credits deducted (8 for free tier)
- ✅ After 30-60s, avatar appears

### Test 3: Check Backend Logs
```bash
pm2 logs backend --lines 20
```

**Should see**:
```
🎨 Selected AI model: FLUX.1-dev Base (avatar-creator:flux-dev-base)
💰 Credit cost: 8
📐 Resolution: 512x512
```

## 🔍 Why Did This Happen?

**Most likely**: Models were never seeded after deployment.

Prisma migrations (`prisma migrate deploy`) do NOT automatically run seeds. Seeds must be run manually:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

**Prevention**: Add seed command to deployment pipeline:
```bash
# In Coolify build script
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma db seed  # ADD THIS
```

## 🛠️ If Fix Doesn't Work

### Scenario 1: Still Getting 500 Error

**Check backend logs**:
```bash
pm2 logs backend --lines 50
```

**Look for**:
- Different error message (not "No AI models available")
- Stack trace showing different issue
- Database connection errors

### Scenario 2: "Insufficient Credits" Error

**Not a bug** - User needs at least 8 credits to generate avatar.

**Check user credits**:
```sql
SELECT id, email, credits FROM "User" WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

**Add credits**:
```sql
UPDATE "User" SET credits = credits + 100 WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### Scenario 3: Models Exist But Still 500

**Check if models are enabled**:
```sql
SELECT "modelKey", enabled FROM "AIModel" WHERE "appId" = 'avatar-creator';
```

**Enable models**:
```sql
UPDATE "AIModel" SET enabled = true WHERE "appId" = 'avatar-creator';
```

## 📞 Escalation Path

If issue persists after:
1. ✅ Running fix
2. ✅ Verifying 4 models exist with `enabled = true`
3. ✅ Testing avatar generation
4. ✅ Checking backend logs

**Then provide**:
1. Full backend logs (last 100 lines)
2. Database query results
3. API error response (full JSON)
4. Frontend console errors (if any)

## 🎯 Action Items

- [ ] Execute `COPY_PASTE_FIX_NOW.txt` commands
- [ ] Verify 4 models exist in database
- [ ] Test avatar generation from UI
- [ ] Check backend logs for success message
- [ ] (Later) Add seed command to deployment pipeline
- [ ] (Later) Add health check endpoint
- [ ] (Later) Add monitoring alerts

## ⏱️ Timeline

| Step | Time | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | 10s | Open Coolify terminal or SSH to production |
| 2 | 30s | Run verification query (check model count) |
| 3 | 30s | Execute seed SQL (insert 4 models) |
| 4 | 20s | Verify models inserted successfully |
| 5 | 30s | Test avatar generation from UI |
| **Total** | **2 min** | Issue resolved ✅ |
