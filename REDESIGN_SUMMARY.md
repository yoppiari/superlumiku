## Design Principles

### 1. Generous Whitespace
Every element has room to breathe. Sections are separated by 48-64px of space. No cramped layouts or cluttered screens.

### 2. Monochromatic Foundation
Black (#000), white (#FFF), and grays form 90% of the interface. Color is used sparingly and functionally, not decoratively.

### 3. Typography-First Hierarchy
Large, bold headings (36-48px) create clear visual hierarchy. Body text is readable (14-16px) in gray-600. Size and weight, not color, establish importance.

### 4. Subtle Interactions
Fast 150ms transitions. Minimal hover effects (2px lift, border color change). No distracting animations. Focus on responsiveness and clarity.

### 5. Scalable Architecture
Designed to handle 50-100+ apps gracefully. Category filtering, search, pagination, and view options ensure efficient browsing at any scale.

---

## Key Features

### App Discovery
- **Category Tabs**: Filter by Video, Image, Audio, Design, AI
- **Search Input**: Live filtering by app name
- **View Toggle**: Grid view (visual) or List view (dense)
- **Pagination**: Show 30 apps per page with numbered controls

### Navigation
- **Desktop Sidebar**: Fixed 224px sidebar with clear active states
- **Mobile Menu**: Slide-in overlay with same navigation items
- **Persistent Context**: Always know where you are in the app

### Information Architecture
- **Stats Bar**: Horizontal row of key metrics (spending, works, projects)
- **App Section**: Dominant focus with filtering and search
- **Recent Activity**: Quick access to recent work
- **Minimal Decoration**: Remove or simplify billing section

## Color Palette

```
Primary Colors:
- Black: #000000 (primary actions, active states)
- White: #FFFFFF (backgrounds, cards)

Gray Scale:
- Gray-50:  #F9FAFB (hover backgrounds)
- Gray-100: #F3F4F6 (icon backgrounds)
- Gray-200: #E5E7EB (borders)
- Gray-400: #9CA3AF (placeholders)

```

**Usage**: 80% grays, 10% black, 10% accents

---

## Spacing System

```
4px  - Tiny gaps, badge padding
8px  - Small gaps between related items
12px - Default gap within components
16px - Gap between components
24px - Large section spacing
32px - Extra large section spacing
48px - Section breaks
64px - Major section breaks
```

**Philosophy**: Double previous spacing for cleaner layouts
