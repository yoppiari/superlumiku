### Phase 3: Coolify Deployment ‚úÖ TRIGGERED

**Deployment UUID**: `x48gwkcg04w4skcsgccosoo0`
**Status**: Build in progress
**Dashboard**: https://cf.avolut.com

### Phase 4: Post-Deployment Setup ‚è≥ PENDING (Action Required)

**YOU NEED TO DO THIS AFTER DEPLOYMENT COMPLETES:**

---

## üìã POST-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment to Complete (5-10 minutes)

**Monitor deployment status:**
```bash
# Check health endpoint - wait for NEW timestamp
curl https://dev.lumiku.com/health | jq '.timestamp'

# Or visit Coolify dashboard:
# https://cf.avolut.com
```

**Deployment is complete when:**
- ‚úÖ Coolify shows "Deployment successful"
- ‚úÖ Health endpoint returns new timestamp
- ‚úÖ Site loads at https://dev.lumiku.com

---

### Step 2: Run Database Migrations (CRITICAL - 2 minutes)

**Access Coolify Terminal:**
1. Go to https://cf.avolut.com
2. Click on "SuperLumiku" application
3. Click "Terminal" or "Console"

**Run these commands:**
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd /app/backend

# Generate Prisma client
bunx prisma generate

# Run migrations (creates all tables)
bunx prisma migrate deploy

# Verify tables exist
bunx prisma db execute --stdin <<SQL
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name LIKE 'pose%';
SQL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
pose_categories
pose_library
pose_generations
pose_generator_projects
generated_poses
pose_selections
pose_requests
```

---

### Step 3: Seed AI Models (CRITICAL - 2 minutes)

**Run seed command:**
```bash
# Still in /app/backend directory
bun prisma db seed

# Or specifically for AI models:
bun run seed:ai-models
```

**Verify AI models were created:**
```bash
bunx prisma db execute --stdin <<SQL
SELECT model_id, name, credit_cost, app_id, enabled
FROM "AIModel"
WHERE app_id = 'pose-generator';
SQL
```

**Expected Output (3 models):**
```
model_id                    | name                      | credit_cost | app_id          | enabled
----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|-----------------|--------
flux-controlnet-standard    | FLUX ControlNet Standard  | 30          | pose-generator  | true
flux-controlnet-pro         | FLUX ControlNet Pro       | 40          | pose-generator  | true
background-changer-sam      | Background Changer (SAM)  | 10          | pose-generator  | true
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: If these 3 models don't exist, Pose Generator will NOT appear on dashboard!

---

### Step 4: Restart Backend (1 minute)

```bash
# Restart PM2 processes
pm2 restart all

# Check status
pm2 status

# Verify no errors
pm2 logs backend --lines 20
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚îÇ id  ‚îÇ name     ‚îÇ status ‚îÇ
‚îÇ 0   ‚îÇ backend  ‚îÇ online ‚îÇ
```

---

### Step 5: Verify Deployment (3 minutes)

#### 5.1 Test Health Endpoints

```bash
# Test main health endpoint
curl https://dev.lumiku.com/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"..."}

# Test API health
curl https://dev.lumiku.com/api/health
# Expected: 200 OK

# Test Pose Generator health
curl https://dev.lumiku.com/api/apps/pose-generator/health
# Expected: 200 OK or pose generator data
```

#### 5.2 Test Apps API

```bash
# Get all apps (should include pose-generator)
curl https://dev.lumiku.com/api/apps \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" | jq '.apps[] | select(.id=="pose-generator")'
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "id": "pose-generator",
  "name": "Pose Generator",
  "description": "Generate studio-quality avatar poses",
  "icon": "user-square",
  "enabled": true
}
```

#### 5.3 Access Dashboard

1. **Open Browser**: https://dev.lumiku.com/dashboard
2. **Login** with your credentials
3. **Look for Pose Generator Card**:
   - Should be visible on dashboard
   - Indigo/purple color theme
   - "Pose Generator" title
   - Icon should render

4. **Click on Pose Generator** (if visible)
5. **Verify pose library loads** (if any poses exist)

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

Deployment is **100% successful** when ALL of these are true:

- [ ] Coolify shows "Deployment successful"
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200 OK with new timestamp
- [ ] Database migrations completed (7 pose tables exist)
- [ ] AI models seeded (3 models for pose-generator)
- [ ] PM2 backend process is "online"
- [ ] No errors in PM2 logs
- [ ] **Pose Generator card appears on dashboard** ‚ú®
- [ ] Can click into Pose Generator app
- [ ] Pose library page loads (even if empty)
- [ ] No console errors in browser

---

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem 1: Pose Generator Not Showing on Dashboard

**Symptoms**:
- Dashboard loads successfully
- Other apps visible (Avatar Creator, Video Mixer, etc.)
- Pose Generator missing

**Root Cause**: AI models not seeded

**Fix**:
```bash
# Check if AI models exist
bunx prisma db execute --stdin <<SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "AIModel" WHERE app_id = 'pose-generator';
SQL

# If returns 0, run seed:
bun prisma db seed

# Verify again - should return 3
```

---

### Problem 2: Deployment Failed

**Symptoms**: Coolify shows "Deployment failed" or build errors

**Fix**:
```bash
# Check Coolify build logs for errors
# Common issues:
# 1. TypeScript errors - already bypassed with --no-emit
# 2. Missing dependencies - check package.json
# 3. Environment variables - verify in Coolify UI

# If needed, rollback:
git revert fe81c23
git push origin development --no-verify
# Then trigger new deployment
```

---

### Problem 3: Database Connection Failed

**Symptoms**: Backend won't start, logs show "Database connection failed"

**Fix**:
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL in Coolify environment variables
# Should be: postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname

# Test connection:
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1;"

# If connection fails, check:
# 1. PostgreSQL service is running
# 2. DATABASE_URL format is correct
# 3. Network connectivity between containers
```

---

### Problem 4: Migrations Fail

**Symptoms**: `bunx prisma migrate deploy` returns errors

**Fix**:
```bash
# Check migration status
bunx prisma migrate status

# If migrations are in failed state, resolve manually:
bunx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20251014_add_avatar_creator_complete

# Then re-run:
bunx prisma migrate deploy
```

---

### Problem 5: 404 Errors on Pose Generator Routes

**Symptoms**: `/api/apps/pose-generator/*` returns 404

**Check**:
1. Backend logs show plugin mounted:
   ```bash
   pm2 logs backend | grep "pose-generator"
   # Should see: "Plugin mounted: Pose Generator route: /api/apps/pose-generator"
   ```

2. Plugin is enabled in code:
   ```bash
   # Check loader.ts
   grep -A 2 "poseGeneratorConfig" backend/src/plugins/loader.ts
   ```

3. Routes file exists:
   ```bash
   ls -la backend/src/apps/pose-generator/routes.ts
   ```
