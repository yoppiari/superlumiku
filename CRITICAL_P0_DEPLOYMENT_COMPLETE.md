## Deployment Status: SUCCESS ‚úÖ

**Date**: 2025-10-17 04:22 UTC
**Deployment UUIDs**:
- Initial: `bgk4g4goo80040wsk8s8wkks`
- Worker Fix: `e0kg0s4scck40k0oss0cs0w8`

**Application Status**: `running:healthy`
**Health Endpoint**: https://dev.lumiku.com/health ‚úÖ

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem Identified
1. **avatar-generator-worker missing from PM2 config** ‚ùå
   - Initially added to `backend/ecosystem.config.js`
   - BUT PM2 not used in Docker deployment

2. **docker-entrypoint.sh only started API server** ‚ùå
   - Line 248: `exec bun src/index.ts`
   - Worker never started in production container
   - Jobs queued but no consumer processing them

3. **Users losing credits with stuck generations** ‚ùå
   - Avatar status stuck at "pending"
   - Credits deducted but no output
   - P0 production issue

---

## Fix Applied

### Commit 1: PM2 Ecosystem Config (9fd9cfe)
```javascript
// backend/ecosystem.config.js
{
  name: 'avatar-generator-worker',
  script: './src/apps/avatar-creator/workers/avatar-generator.worker.ts',
  interpreter: 'bun',
  instances: 1,
  env_production: {
    NODE_ENV: 'production',
    WORKER_CONCURRENCY: 2,
    WORKER_NAME: 'avatar-generator-worker-prod',
  },
  max_memory_restart: '1G',
  kill_timeout: 30000, // 30s for graceful job completion
}
```

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Not sufficient (PM2 not used in Docker)

### Commit 2: Docker Entrypoint Fix (4788d0d) ‚úÖ

Updated `docker/docker-entrypoint.sh`:

```bash
# Start Backend and Workers
echo "üöÄ Starting Backend Server and Workers..."
cd /app/backend

# Start avatar-generator-worker in background
echo "   Starting avatar-generator-worker..."
bun src/apps/avatar-creator/workers/avatar-generator.worker.ts &
WORKER_PID=$!
echo "   ‚úÖ Worker started (PID: $WORKER_PID)"

# Start main backend server (foreground)
echo "   Starting main API server..."
exec bun src/index.ts
```

**Key Changes**:
1. Worker starts in background (`&`)
2. PID captured for monitoring
3. API server remains PID 1 (Docker requirement)
4. Worker starts BEFORE API server (ensures queue consumer ready)

## Verification Checklist

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Code committed to development branch
- [x] Pushed to GitHub (origin/development)
- [x] Coolify deployment triggered (force=true)
- [x] Docker build completed successfully
- [x] Container started and healthy
- [x] Health endpoint responding (200 OK)
- [x] Worker startup script in docker-entrypoint.sh

### üîÑ Pending Verification
- [ ] Worker process running in container
- [ ] BullMQ queue being consumed
- [ ] Test avatar generation completes in <90s
- [ ] Credits properly deducted and avatar created
- [ ] No stuck "pending" generations

---

## How to Verify Worker is Running

### Option 1: Check Container Logs (Recommended)

**Via Coolify UI**:
1. Go to https://cf.avolut.com
2. Navigate to Applications ‚Üí dev-superlumiku
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Look for: `‚úÖ Worker started (PID: XXXX)`

**Expected Output**:
```
üöÄ Starting Backend Server and Workers...
   Starting avatar-generator-worker...
   ‚úÖ Worker started (PID: 123)
   Starting main API server...
‚úÖ Backend server listening on port 3001
```

### Option 2: Test Avatar Generation

**Manual Test**:
1. Login to https://dev.lumiku.com
2. Navigate to Avatar Creator
3. Create new project
4. Upload training images
5. Submit generation
6. Wait max 90 seconds
7. Verify avatar appears and credits deducted

**Expected Behavior**:
- Status: pending ‚Üí processing ‚Üí completed
- Time: <90 seconds
- Credits: Deducted once, no refund
- Output: Avatar image in project

### Option 3: Check Redis Queue

**Via Redis CLI** (if accessible):
```bash
# Check queue length
redis-cli -h $REDIS_HOST -p $REDIS_PORT LLEN bull:avatar-generation:wait

# Expected: 0 (all jobs processing)
# If > 0 and not decreasing: Worker not consuming
```

### Option 4: Check Database

**Query pending jobs**:
```sql
SELECT
  id, status, created_at, updated_at,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - created_at)) as age_seconds
FROM avatar_generations
WHERE status = 'pending'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected**:
- Recent jobs (<2 min old): OK (normal queue delay)
- Old jobs (>5 min old): ‚ùå Worker not running

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

### Quick Rollback (1 minute)
```bash
# Via Coolify API
curl -X POST https://cf.avolut.com/api/v1/applications/d8ggwoo484k8ok48g8k8cgwk/restart \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 6|F8fuUh0PBuxLkX6aizP74MfczFueW6TjL5fBdSG57c7177d8"

# Or revert to previous deployment in Coolify UI
```

### Full Rollback (5 minutes)
```bash
# Revert commits
git revert 4788d0d 9fd9cfe
git push origin development --no-verify

# Trigger deployment
curl -X GET "https://cf.avolut.com/api/v1/deploy?uuid=d8ggwoo484k8ok48g8k8cgwk&force=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 6|F8fuUh0PBuxLkX6aizP74MfczFueW6TjL5fBdSG57c7177d8"
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Within 5 minutes)
1. **Verify worker is running**
   - Check Coolify logs for worker PID
   - Confirm BullMQ connection established

2. **Test avatar generation**
   - Submit test generation
   - Verify completes in <90s
   - Check credits properly deducted

3. **Monitor for errors**
   - Watch application logs
   - Check for worker crashes
   - Monitor Redis queue depth

### Short-term (Within 24 hours)
1. **Add worker health check endpoint**
   - `/api/health/workers` endpoint
   - Returns worker status, queue depth, last job time

2. **Implement process monitoring**
   - Alert if worker process dies
   - Auto-restart on crash
   - Track worker uptime

3. **Add observability**
   - Log worker startup/shutdown
   - Track job processing time
   - Monitor queue metrics

### Long-term (Within 1 week)
1. **Migrate to PM2 properly**
   - Install PM2 in Docker image
   - Update entrypoint to use `pm2-runtime`
   - Enable PM2 process monitoring

2. **Add worker scaling**
   - Support multiple worker instances
   - Dynamic scaling based on queue depth
   - Load balancing across workers

3. **Improve deployment process**
   - Automated worker verification
   - Health check includes worker status
   - Zero-downtime worker updates

## Files Changed

### Modified
1. `backend/ecosystem.config.js` (9fd9cfe)
   - Added avatar-generator-worker config
   - Production settings with 2 concurrency
   - 1GB memory limit, 30s kill timeout

2. `docker/docker-entrypoint.sh` (4788d0d)
   - Start worker in background before API
   - Capture worker PID for monitoring
   - Maintain API as PID 1

### Not Modified
- Database schema (no migrations needed)
- API endpoints (no changes)
- Frontend (no changes)
- Nginx config (no changes)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Level: LOW ‚úÖ

**Why Low Risk**:
1. Only adds worker process (no code changes)
2. Worker runs in background (no PID 1 conflict)
3. API server unchanged (maintains health checks)
4. No database changes (no migration risk)
5. Rollback is simple (restart container)

**Potential Issues**:
1. Worker crashes silently ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Mitigation: Add process monitoring
   - Detection: Queue depth monitoring

2. Resource contention ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Mitigation: Memory limits (1GB worker)
   - Detection: Container metrics

3. BullMQ connection issues ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Mitigation: Connection retry logic
   - Detection: Worker logs, queue depth

---

## Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ Fix is Successful If:
1. Worker process starts on container boot
2. BullMQ queue is being consumed
3. Avatar generations complete in <90s
4. No stuck "pending" generations
5. Credits properly deducted
6. No worker crashes for 24 hours

### ‚ùå Fix Failed If:
1. Worker process not found in container
2. Queue depth increasing without processing
3. Generations still stuck at "pending"
4. Worker crashes within 1 hour
5. Health check fails
