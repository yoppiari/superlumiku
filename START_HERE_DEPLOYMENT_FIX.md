## The 2-Minute Fix (Emergency)

If you need the absolute fastest fix:

### 1. Open Coolify Terminal
- Go to: https://cf.avolut.com
- Navigate to: **dev-superlumiku** ‚Üí **Terminal**

### 2. Fix Database Connection
```bash
echo $DATABASE_URL
```
- If it shows `107.155.75.50` ‚Üí **This is the problem!**
- Go to: **Environment** tab
- Change DATABASE_URL to use internal hostname (e.g., `coolify-postgres`)

### 3. Fix Migration
```bash
bunx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20251014_add_avatar_creator_complete
```

### 4. Redeploy
- Go to: **Deployments** ‚Üí **Redeploy**
- Check: ‚úÖ Force Rebuild
- Wait 5 minutes

### 5. Verify
```bash
curl https://dev.lumiku.com/health
```
Should return: `{"status":"ok"}`

## What's Wrong (Simple Explanation)

### Error 1: Database Can't Connect
**Problem**: Your app is trying to connect to PostgreSQL at IP `107.155.75.50` but can't reach it.

**Why**: In Docker/Coolify, services talk to each other using internal names, not external IPs.

**Fix**: Change DATABASE_URL from external IP to internal service name.

**Analogy**: It's like trying to call someone using their street address instead of their phone number.

---

### Error 2: "Module Not Found"
**Problem**: Build says it can't find `pose-websocket` file.

**Why**: The file DOES exist! This is an old error stuck in Docker's build cache.

**Fix**: Force rebuild without cache.

**Analogy**: Like your browser showing an old cached version of a website.

---

### Error 3: Migration Failed (But Didn't Really)
**Problem**: Database migration marked as "failed" but tables were actually created.

**Why**: Migration probably timed out or had a transient error, but the SQL commands succeeded.

**Fix**: Tell Prisma "actually, that migration worked fine."

**Analogy**: Like failing a test on a technicality even though you got all the answers right.

## Common Questions

### Q: Will this delete my data?
**A**: No! All fixes are non-destructive. We're just fixing configuration, not touching data.

### Q: Can I rollback if something goes wrong?
**A**: Yes! Coolify lets you redeploy any previous deployment. Just click on an old deployment and hit "Redeploy."

### Q: How long will the site be down?
**A**: It's already down. These fixes will get it back up in ~15 minutes.

### Q: Do I need to change any code?
**A**: No! All issues are infrastructure/configuration. No code changes needed.

### Q: What if the fix doesn't work?
**A**: See "Troubleshooting" section in QUICK_FIX_NOW.md or COOLIFY_CHECKLIST.md. Each has fallback options.

### Q: Is this safe to do in production?
**A**: Yes! These are standard database/deployment operations. Low risk, easy rollback.

## What NOT to Do

‚ùå **Don't** try to fix by redeploying without changes (won't work)
‚ùå **Don't** reset the database (will lose data)
‚ùå **Don't** edit code (not a code problem)
‚ùå **Don't** panic (this is fixable!)

‚úÖ **Do** follow the guides step-by-step
‚úÖ **Do** test database connection first
‚úÖ **Do** fix migration state
‚úÖ **Do** force rebuild
‚úÖ **Do** verify after deployment

## Support

### If You Get Stuck

1. **Check the specific guide** you're using (QUICK_FIX_NOW.md has troubleshooting)

3. **Check Coolify logs** - look for red error messages
4. **Verify each step completed** - don't skip steps

### Common Gotchas

1. **DATABASE_URL not updated** - Most common issue. Must use internal hostname.
2. **PostgreSQL service not running** - Check Services tab, restart if needed.
3. **Forgot to Force Rebuild** - Build cache will show old errors.
4. **Didn't wait for deployment** - Takes 3-5 minutes, be patient.
