# FLUX 400 Error - ROOT CAUSE FOUND & FIXED

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED & TESTED LOCALLY | ‚è≥ PENDING PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT
**Commit:** bc44db9

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Error Reported
```
AI provider error (FLUX): Request failed with status code 400
```

### Investigation Method
Created direct API test script (`test-flux-api.ts`) to diagnose the exact error from HuggingFace Inference API.

### Root Cause Identified
```json
{
  "error": "Accept type 'application/json, text/plain, */*' not supported.
           Supported accept types are: image/png, image/jpeg, image/jpg, ..."
}
```

**Problem:** Axios was sending default `Accept: application/json` header, but HuggingFace Inference API for image generation requires `Accept: image/png` or similar image MIME type.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### Files Modified
1. `backend/src/lib/huggingface-client.ts` - Added `'Accept': 'image/png'` header to ALL image generation methods

### Changes Made
Added `'Accept': 'image/png'` to axios headers in:

1. **FLUX.1-dev** (line 167-179)
   ```typescript
   headers: {
     'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.apiKey}`,
     'Content-Type': 'application/json',
     'Accept': 'image/png'  // ‚Üê ADDED
   }
   ```

2. **FLUX.1-schnell fallback** (line 259-271)
3. **ControlNet imageToImage** (line 41-64)
4. **SDXL textToImage** (via HfInference library - no change needed)
5. **Inpainting** (line 294-317)
6. **PhotoMaker V2** (line 435-447)

---

## üß™ Test Results

### Before Fix
```
FLUX.1-dev:    ‚ùå FAILS (400 Bad Request)
FLUX.1-schnell: ‚ùå FAILS (400 Bad Request)
SDXL:          ‚ùå FAILS (400 Bad Request)
```

### After Fix
```
‚úÖ FLUX.1-dev:    WORKS (1.17 MB image generated)
‚úÖ FLUX.1-schnell: WORKS (1.19 MB image generated)
‚úÖ SDXL:          WORKS (1.38 MB image generated)
```

**Test Command:**
```bash
npx tsx test-flux-api.ts
```

## üì¶ Deployment Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Root cause identified
- [x] Fix implemented in `huggingface-client.ts`
- [x] Tested locally with all 3 models
- [x] Code committed to Git (bc44db9)
- [x] Pushed to GitHub (development branch)

### ‚è≥ Pending
- [ ] Deploy to Coolify (dev.lumiku.com)
- [ ] Verify in production

---

## üöÄ Deploy to Production (MANUAL STEP REQUIRED)

### Option 1: Coolify Web UI
1. Login to Coolify dashboard
2. Navigate to dev.lumiku.com application
3. Click "Deploy" button
4. Wait for deployment to complete

### Option 2: Coolify API (if you have valid token)
```bash
curl -X GET \
  "https://cf.avolut.com/api/v1/deploy?uuid=d8ggwoo484k8ok48g8k8cgwk&force=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_COOLIFY_TOKEN"
```

### Option 3: Auto-deploy via Webhook
If Coolify auto-deploy is enabled, deployment should trigger automatically from GitHub push.

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps (After Deployment)

1. **Test Avatar Generation:**
   - Go to dev.lumiku.com/apps/avatar-creator
   - Create a new project
   - Click "Generate with AI"
   - Enter prompt: "ibu rumah tangga indonesia yang modis"
   - Select FLUX model
   - Click Generate

2. **Expected Result:**
   - Generation should start successfully
   - No 400 error
   - Avatar generated in 60-90 seconds
   - Image displayed in "Your Avatars" section

3. **Test All Models:**
   - FLUX.1-dev (if you have PRO subscription)
   - FLUX.1-schnell (free tier)
   - SDXL models
   - PhotoMaker V2 (if seeded to database)

---

## üìä Impact

### Fixed Issues
- ‚úÖ FLUX 400 error on all text-to-image generations
- ‚úÖ Avatar Creator not working with FLUX models
- ‚úÖ PhotoMaker V2 would have had same issue
- ‚úÖ ControlNet pose generation would have failed
- ‚úÖ Inpainting (hijab/accessories) would have failed

### User Experience
- **Before:** All avatar generations failed with 400 error
- **After:** Avatar generation works smoothly with all models

---

## üîß Technical Details

### Why This Happened
HuggingFace Inference API has strict requirements for image generation endpoints:
- They expect `Accept` header to match output type
- For image generation: `Accept: image/png`, `image/jpeg`, etc.
- Axios default `Accept: application/json` is rejected

### Why We Didn't Catch This Earlier
- Most APIs are lenient with Accept headers
- HuggingFace Inference API is strict about content negotiation
- Error message was generic "400 Bad Request" without detail
- Had to make direct API call to see full error response

### Future Prevention
- All new image generation endpoints MUST include `Accept: image/png`
- Add to code review checklist
- Consider creating a shared axios instance with correct headers

## üìù Code Changes Summary

```typescript
// BEFORE
const response = await axios.post(url, data, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  responseType: 'arraybuffer'
})

// AFTER
const response = await axios.post(url, data, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Accept': 'image/png'  // ‚Üê CRITICAL FIX
  },
  responseType: 'arraybuffer'
})
```

**Total Lines Changed:** 10 insertions, 5 deletions
**Files Modified:** 1 file (`backend/src/lib/huggingface-client.ts`)

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATELY:** Deploy to Coolify using one of the methods above
2. **After deployment:** Test avatar generation with prompt "ibu rumah tangga indonesia yang modis"
3. **Verify:** All models work (FLUX, SDXL, PhotoMaker)
4. **Report back:** Confirm generation is working in production

---

## üìû Support

If generation still fails after deployment, check:
1. Coolify deployment logs for errors
2. HuggingFace API quota/rate limits
3. HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY environment variable is set correctly

---

**STATUS:** ‚úÖ Fix ready, tested, and pushed to GitHub. Waiting for production deployment to complete.
