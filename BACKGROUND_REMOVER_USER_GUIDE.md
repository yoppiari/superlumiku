## Tips & Best Practices

### Choosing Quality Tier

**Basic (3 credits)**:
- Simple backgrounds (solid colors, studio shots)
- Low-res social media posts
- Draft/preview work

**Standard (8 credits)**:
- Most use cases
- E-commerce products
- Web images
- Good balance of quality and cost

**Professional (15 credits)**:
- Complex backgrounds
- Fine details (hair, fur, transparent objects)
- High-res images
- Print materials

**Industry (25 credits)**:
- Maximum quality
- Professional photography
- Large format prints
- Critical projects

### Batch Upload Best Practices

1. **Consistent images**: Same type (all products, all portraits)
2. **Same quality tier**: One tier per batch for predictable cost
3. **Batch naming**: Use descriptive names ("Wedding Photos Bride", "Product SKU 100-150")
4. **File size**: Keep under 10MB each
5. **Monitor progress**: Check Jobs tab, auto-refreshes every 5s

### Credit Management

**Subscription vs Pay-per-use**:

| Scenario | Best Option | Reason |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| 5 removals/day | Pay-per-use | 150 credits/month vs 99,000 IDR |
| 20 removals/day | Starter plan | 600 credits vs unlimited in plan |
| 100 removals/day | Pro plan | Unlimited vs 3,000+ credits |

**Example calculation**:
- Standard tier = 8 credits each
- 50 removals = 400 credits (costs more than Starter plan)
- If doing 50+/day â†’ Subscribe!

## Troubleshooting

### Job stuck in "Processing"
- **Normal wait**: 10-60 seconds per image
- **Check after**: 2 minutes
- **If still stuck**: Contact support with Job ID

### Job failed with error
- **Common causes**: File too large, unsupported format, corrupt image
- **Fix**: Try again with different image or smaller size
- **Credits**: Refunded automatically for failed jobs

### Batch download not working

- **Daily reset**: Resets at midnight (server time)
- **Verify**: Top stats bar shows plan + remaining
