## 5. SCHEMA DISCREPANCIES FOUND

During execution, we discovered that the production database schema differs from the Prisma schema:

### Missing Columns in `avatar_generations` table:

1. **`avatarId` column** - Does not exist in production
   - **Impact**: Could not delete avatar generations linked to avatars
   - **Mitigation**: Skipped gracefully

2. **`projectId` column** - Does not exist in production
   - **Impact**: Could not delete avatar generations linked to project
   - **Mitigation**: Skipped gracefully

### Missing Columns in `pose_generations` table:

3. **`generationType` column** - Does not exist in production
   - **Impact**: Initial attempts to query with Prisma failed
   - **Mitigation**: Used raw SQL queries instead

**‚ö†Ô∏è RECOMMENDATION**: Run database migration to sync production schema with Prisma schema:
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

---

## 6. ISSUES ENCOUNTERED AND RESOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: Schema Mismatch
**Problem**: Production database schema doesn't match Prisma schema
**Error**: `column "generationType" does not exist`
**Resolution**: Used raw SQL queries with schema checks before deletion

### Issue 2: Missing Columns
**Problem**: `avatarId` and `projectId` columns missing from `avatar_generations` table
**Error**: `column "avatarId" does not exist`
**Resolution**: Added schema validation before attempting deletion, skipped gracefully

### Issue 3: Transaction Abort
**Problem**: Unhandled errors in raw SQL caused transaction rollback
**Error**: `current transaction is aborted`
**Resolution**: Wrapped all raw SQL queries in try-catch with proper error handling
