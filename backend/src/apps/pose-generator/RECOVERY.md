## Overview

### Key Features

- **Automatic Recovery**: Detects stalled jobs on worker startup
- **Checkpoint Resume**: Continues from last completed pose (no duplicate work)
- **Zero Data Loss**: All progress saved to database in real-time
- **Timeout Protection**: Marks jobs as failed after 2 hours
- **Periodic Checks**: Runs recovery every 30 minutes
- **Admin Tools**: Manual trigger and monitoring endpoints

### Recovery Triggers

The system recovers jobs in three scenarios:

1. **Worker Startup Recovery** (Automatic)
   - Runs when worker process starts
   - Finds generations stuck in "processing" for > 30 minutes
   - Re-queues with checkpoint data
   - High priority for recovery jobs

2. **Periodic Recovery Check** (Automatic)
   - Runs every 30 minutes while worker is running
   - Catches jobs that stall during operation
   - Prevents long delays in recovery

3. **Manual Recovery Trigger** (Admin Only)
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/apps/pose-generator/recovery/trigger`
   - Can be triggered manually if issues detected
   - Useful for testing and emergency recovery

---

## How It Works

### 1. Detection Phase

The recovery service identifies stalled jobs by:

```typescript
// Find generations stuck in "processing" for > 30 minutes
const thirtyMinutesAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 30 * 60 * 1000)
const stuckGenerations = await prisma.poseGeneration.findMany({
  where: {
    status: 'processing',
    startedAt: { lt: thirtyMinutesAgo },
  },
})
```

### 2. Validation Phase

For each stalled generation, the system:

1. **Checks Completion**: Verifies if actually incomplete
   ```typescript
   if (posesCompleted + posesFailed >= totalExpectedPoses) {
     // Mark as completed (was already done)
   }
   ```

2. **Checks Queue**: Ensures no active BullMQ job exists
   ```typescript
   const existingJob = await queue.getJob(generation.queueJobId)
   if (existingJob && await existingJob.isActive()) {
     // Skip (job is still running)
   }
   ```

3. **Re-queues Job**: Adds job with `isRecovery: true` flag
   ```typescript
   const job = await queue.add('generate-poses-recovery', {
     ...jobData,
     isRecovery: true, // Flag for recovery
   }, {
     priority: 1, // High priority
   })
   ```

### 3. Resume Phase

The worker resumes from the last checkpoint:

```typescript
// Load checkpoint
const startIndex = generation.posesCompleted || 0

// Skip already-generated poses
if (startIndex > 0) {
  console.log(`Resuming from pose ${startIndex}`)
}

// Continue generation from checkpoint
for (let i = startIndex; i < totalExpectedPoses; i++) {
  await generatePose(i)
}
```

## Recovery Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Worker Crash Mid-Generation

**What Happens:**
1. Worker is generating pose 15 of 50
2. Process crashes (OOM, SIGKILL, server reboot)
3. Generation stuck in "processing" status
4. Database shows `posesCompleted: 14`

**Recovery:**
1. Worker restarts, runs startup recovery
2. Finds generation stuck for > 30 minutes
3. Re-queues job with `isRecovery: true`
4. Worker resumes from pose 15 (skips poses 1-14)
5. Completes remaining poses 15-50

**Result:** Zero data loss, no duplicate work

---

### Scenario 2: Network Failure to Redis

**What Happens:**
1. Worker loses connection to Redis
2. Job marked as "active" in queue but worker can't update status
3. Job appears stalled after 30 minutes

**Recovery:**
1. Periodic recovery check (runs every 30 minutes)
2. Detects job stuck in "processing"
3. Checks if Redis job is still active
4. If not active, re-queues job
5. Worker picks up and resumes

**Result:** Automatic recovery without manual intervention

---

### Scenario 3: Database Connection Lost

**What Happens:**
1. Worker loses connection to PostgreSQL
2. Can't save pose records or update progress
3. Generation fails after exhausting retries

**Recovery:**
1. Worker marks generation as "failed"
2. Credits refunded to user
3. User can retry manually
4. Database reconnects automatically on retry

**Result:** Graceful failure with automatic refund

---

### Scenario 4: Partial Completion (Some Poses Failed)

**What Happens:**
1. Worker generates 40 of 50 poses
2. 10 poses fail due to FLUX API errors
3. Generation marked as "completed" with partial results

**Recovery:**
Not needed - this is handled by partial failure logic:
1. Failed poses are refunded (10 × 30 = 300 credits)
2. User gets 40 completed poses
3. User charged only for successful poses

**Result:** Fair billing, no wasted credits

---

## Checkpoint System

### How Checkpoints Work

Each generation tracks progress in the database:

```typescript
interface PoseGeneration {
  posesCompleted: number    // Number of successfully generated poses
  posesFailed: number        // Number of failed poses
  progress: number           // Percentage (0-100)
  startedAt: DateTime        // When generation started
  status: string             // queued | processing | completed | failed
}
```

### Checkpoint Updates

Progress is saved to database every 5 poses:

```typescript
if (posesCompleted % 5 === 0 || posesCompleted === totalExpectedPoses) {
  await updateProgress(generationId, posesCompleted, totalExpectedPoses)
}
```

This ensures:
- Maximum 5 poses lost on crash (minimal waste)
- Database not overwhelmed with updates
- Fast recovery (resume from recent checkpoint)

### Resume Logic

On recovery, worker uses checkpoint to skip already-generated poses:

```typescript
// Gallery mode: Check each pose variation
const alreadyGenerated = generation.poses.some(
  (p) => p.poseLibraryId === libraryPose.id && p.status === 'completed'
)

if (alreadyGenerated && posesCompleted > 0) {
  console.log('Pose already generated, skipping')
  continue
}
```

---

## Failure Handling

### Timeout Failures

Generations processing for > 2 hours are marked as failed:

```typescript
async markFailedGenerations(): Promise<number> {
  const twoHoursAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000)

  const result = await prisma.poseGeneration.updateMany({
    where: {
      status: 'processing',
      startedAt: { lt: twoHoursAgo },
    },
    data: {
      status: 'failed',
      errorMessage: 'Generation timeout - exceeded 2 hour limit',
    },
  })

  return result.count
}
```

**Why 2 Hours?**
- Average generation: 30 seconds per pose
- 50 poses: ~25 minutes
- 2 hours = generous buffer for retries and delays
- Prevents indefinite stuck states

### Partial Completions

If some poses completed before failure:
1. User is charged only for completed poses
2. Failed poses are refunded automatically
3. User can retry failed poses separately

### Corrupted State

If pose count doesn't match database records:
1. Re-generates from checkpoint (safe)
2. Logs warning for debugging
3. Continues normally

## Monitoring & Observability

### Check Recovery Status

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/apps/pose-generator/recovery/status`

**Authentication:** Admin only

**Response:**
```json
{
  "stalledGenerations": 2,
  "queuedGenerations": 5,
  "processingGenerations": 3,
  "lastRecoveryRun": "2025-10-14T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Trigger Manual Recovery

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/apps/pose-generator/recovery/trigger`

**Authentication:** Admin only

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "recovered": 2,
  "failed": 0
}
```

### Logs to Monitor

Recovery logs are clearly marked:

```
[Recovery] Starting job recovery...
[Recovery] Found 3 stuck generations in database
[Recovery] Recovering generation abc123 (15/50 completed)
[Recovery] Re-queuing generation abc123 from checkpoint 15
[Recovery] Successfully re-queued generation abc123 as job 456
[Recovery] Recovery complete: 3 recovered, 0 failed
```

Worker logs show recovery mode:

```
[Worker] Processing generation abc123
[Worker] RECOVERY MODE: Resuming from checkpoint
[Worker] Resuming from checkpoint: 15/50 poses completed
[Worker] Recovery: Skipping 15 already completed poses
```

## Testing Recovery

### Test 1: Worker Crash Mid-Generation

```bash
# 1. Start a generation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/apps/pose-generator/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": "PROJECT_ID",
    "generationType": "TEXT_DESCRIPTION",
    "textPrompt": "professional standing pose",
    "variationCount": 50
  }'

# 2. Monitor progress
curl http://localhost:3000/api/apps/pose-generator/generations/GENERATION_ID

# 3. Kill worker mid-generation (when posesCompleted is around 25)
pkill -9 -f pose-generation.worker

# 4. Restart worker
cd backend
bun src/apps/pose-generator/worker.ts

# 5. Verify recovery in logs
# Should see:
# - "🔄 Running startup recovery..."
# - "Found 1 stuck generations in database"
# - "Re-queuing generation GENERATION_ID from checkpoint 25"
# - "RECOVERY MODE: Resuming from checkpoint"

# 6. Verify generation completes
curl http://localhost:3000/api/apps/pose-generator/generations/GENERATION_ID
# Should show: posesCompleted: 50, status: "completed"
```

### Test 2: Periodic Recovery

```bash
# 1. Simulate stuck job by manually updating database
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  UPDATE pose_generation
  SET status = 'processing',
      started_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '45 minutes'
  WHERE id = 'GENERATION_ID'
"

# 2. Wait for periodic recovery (runs every 30 minutes)
# OR trigger manually:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/apps/pose-generator/recovery/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"

# 3. Verify recovery
# Check logs for "Periodic recovery: 1 jobs recovered"
```

### Test 3: Timeout Handling

```bash
# 1. Simulate very old stuck job
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  UPDATE pose_generation
  SET status = 'processing',
      started_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '3 hours'
  WHERE id = 'GENERATION_ID'
"

# 2. Trigger recovery
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/apps/pose-generator/recovery/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"

# 3. Verify marked as failed
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT status, error_message
  FROM pose_generation
  WHERE id = 'GENERATION_ID'
"
# Should show: status = 'failed', error_message = 'Generation timeout - exceeded 2 hour limit'
```

### Data Flow

1. **Normal Flow:**
   ```
   User Request → API → Queue Job → Worker → Generate Poses → Complete
   ```

2. **Recovery Flow:**
   ```
   Worker Crash → Generation Stuck → Recovery Detects → Re-queue → Worker Resumes → Complete
   ```

### State Transitions

```
queued → processing → completed
   │         │            ▲

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Recovery Not Running

**Symptoms:**
- Worker starts but no recovery logs
- Stalled jobs not recovered

**Solutions:**
1. Check worker startup logs for errors
2. Verify database connection
3. Manually trigger recovery:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/apps/pose-generator/recovery/trigger \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
   ```

### Problem: Jobs Marked as Failed Too Quickly

**Symptoms:**
- Jobs marked as failed before completing
- Timeout errors in logs

**Solutions:**
1. Check if worker is running
2. Increase timeout (edit `recovery.service.ts`):
   ```typescript
   const fourHoursAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 4 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 4 hours instead of 2
   ```
3. Check FLUX API latency

### Problem: Duplicate Poses Generated

**Symptoms:**
- Same pose generated twice
- User charged twice

**Solutions:**
This shouldn't happen due to checkpoint system, but if it does:
1. Check database for duplicate pose records
2. Verify `alreadyGenerated` logic in worker
3. Review logs for recovery mode messages
4. Manually refund user if needed

### Problem: Recovery Loop (Job Re-queued Repeatedly)

**Symptoms:**
- Same job recovered multiple times
- Job never completes

**Solutions:**
1. Check worker logs for errors during processing
2. Verify Redis connection is stable
3. Check if job is hitting retry limit
4. Manually mark as failed if needed:
   ```sql
   UPDATE pose_generation
   SET status = 'failed',
       error_message = 'Manual intervention - recovery loop'
   WHERE id = 'GENERATION_ID'
   ```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Recovery Overhead

- **Startup Recovery**: ~1-2 seconds per 100 generations
- **Periodic Recovery**: ~1-2 seconds per 100 generations
- **Database Queries**: Indexed on `status` and `startedAt`
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (processes one generation at a time)

### Scaling Recovery

For high-volume deployments:

1. **Multiple Workers**: Recovery is idempotent, safe to run on all workers
2. **Database Indexing**: Ensure index on `(status, startedAt)`:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_pose_generation_recovery
   ON pose_generation(status, started_at)
   WHERE status = 'processing'
   ```
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for high stalled job counts

---

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor Recovery Stats**: Check `/recovery/status` daily
2. **Alert on High Stalled Count**: > 10 stalled jobs = investigate
3. **Review Recovery Logs**: Look for patterns in failures
4. **Test Recovery Regularly**: Monthly recovery drills
5. **Keep Worker Healthy**: Monitor memory, CPU, network
6. **Update Documentation**: Record any new failure modes
