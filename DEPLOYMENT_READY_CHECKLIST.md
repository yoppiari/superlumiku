# DEPLOYMENT READY CHECKLIST

## Status: ✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION

All CRITICAL (P0) blockers have been fixed. Review this checklist before deploying.

---

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### 1. Environment Variables (REQUIRED)

```bash
# Redis Configuration (REQUIRED in production)
REDIS_HOST=your-redis-host.com
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=your-secure-password

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/lumiku

# JWT Secret (must be 32+ characters)
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-here

# CORS
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-domain.com

# Payment Gateway (Duitku)
DUITKU_MERCHANT_CODE=your-merchant-code
DUITKU_API_KEY=your-api-key
DUITKU_CALLBACK_URL=https://api.lumiku.com/api/payments/callback
DUITKU_RETURN_URL=https://app.lumiku.com/payment/success
```

### 2. Database Migration

```bash
# Run migration (now wrapped in transaction for safety)
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Verify tables created
psql -U postgres -d lumiku -c "\dt"

# Expected tables:
# - avatar_projects
# - avatars
# - avatar_presets
# - persona_examples
# - avatar_usage_history
# - avatar_generations
# - pose_categories
# - pose_library
# - pose_generator_projects
# - pose_generations
# - generated_poses
# - pose_selections
# - pose_requests
```

### 3. Redis Connectivity

```bash
# Test Redis connection
redis-cli -h your-redis-host -a your-password ping

# Expected output: PONG

# Test from application
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### 4. Storage Directories

```bash
# Ensure directories exist and are writable
mkdir -p uploads/avatar-creator
mkdir -p uploads/pose-generator
mkdir -p outputs

# Set permissions
chmod 755 uploads outputs
```

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript
npm run build

# Or use production build
npm run build:production
```

### 2. Start Application

```bash
# Production mode
NODE_ENV=production npm start

# Or with PM2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production
```

### 3. Verify Startup

Check logs for these messages:

```
✅ Environment variables validated successfully
✅ Database connected successfully
✅ Redis connected successfully
✅ Pose Generator queue initialized
✅ Pose Generator storage initialized
✅ WebSocket server initialized for Pose Generator
✅ Server started successfully
```

**If you see any ❌ messages, investigate before proceeding.**

---

## Post-Deployment Tests

### 1. Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Expected: 200 OK with JSON response
```

### 2. Test Pose Generator Plugin

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/apps/pose-generator/health

# Expected: 200 OK
```

### 3. Test Credit System

```bash
# This requires authenticated request
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/apps/avatar-creator/projects/:projectId/avatars/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "test", "name": "test"}'

# Expected: 200 OK with creditUsed and creditBalance in response
```

### 4. Test WebSocket

```javascript
// Use Socket.IO client
import io from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('http://localhost:3000/pose-generator', {
  auth: { token: 'YOUR_JWT_TOKEN' }
});

socket.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('✅ WebSocket connected');
});

socket.on('generation:progress', (data) => {
  console.log('Progress:', data);
});
```

### 5. Test Concurrent Credit Deductions

```bash
# Run multiple requests simultaneously
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/apps/avatar-creator/projects/:projectId/avatars/upload \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
    -F "image=@test.jpg" &
done
wait

# Verify: Check user's credit balance
# Expected: Credits should be deducted correctly, no overdrafts
```

---

## Monitoring Setup

### 1. Log Monitoring

Watch for these log patterns:

**Good**:
```
✅ Avatar generation completed
✅ Pose Generator queue initialized
✅ Redis connection ready
```

**Warning**:
```
⚠️  Redis connection error
⚠️  Credit refund failed
⚠️  Could not update app stats
```

**Critical**:
```
❌ Database connection failed
❌ FATAL: Redis connection failed in production
❌❌❌ CRITICAL: Failed to refund credits
```

### 2. Metrics to Track

- **Redis Connection**: Uptime, connection failures
- **Credit Transactions**: Success rate, transaction conflicts
- **Queue Jobs**: Pending, active, completed, failed
- **WebSocket Connections**: Active connections, disconnect rate
- **JSON Parse Errors**: Frequency, affected endpoints

### 3. Alerts to Configure

| Alert | Condition | Severity |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Redis Down | Connection fails > 5 minutes | CRITICAL |
| Credit Refund Failure | Any occurrence | HIGH |
| Migration Rollback | Any occurrence | HIGH |
| JSON Parse Error Rate | > 10/minute | MEDIUM |
| Queue Job Failure | > 5% failure rate | MEDIUM |

---

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:

### 1. Quick Rollback

```bash
# Stop current deployment
pm2 stop all

# Revert to previous version
git checkout previous-version-tag

# Restart
npm install
npm run build
pm2 start all
```

### 2. Database Rollback

```bash
# If migration caused issues
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 20251014_add_avatar_creator_complete

# Revert to previous migration
npx prisma migrate reset --force
```

### 3. Redis Issues

If Redis is causing problems:

```bash
# Temporarily disable Pose Generator (NOT RECOMMENDED for production)
# Set in environment:
REDIS_ENABLED=false

# Note: This will disable:
# - Pose Generator features
# - WebSocket real-time updates
# - Distributed rate limiting (security risk)
```

---

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:

- [x] All environment variables configured
- [x] Database migration completed without errors
- [x] Redis connected and responding
- [x] Application starts without errors
- [x] Health check returns 200 OK
- [x] Pose Generator plugin enabled
- [x] WebSocket connections working
- [x] Credit system handling transactions correctly
- [x] No critical errors in logs for 15 minutes

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Safe JSON Parsing**: Utility created but not yet integrated into all 77 call sites
   - Impact: Some endpoints may still crash on malformed JSON
   - Mitigation: Monitor logs, prioritize fixing high-traffic endpoints

2. **Rate Limiting**: Requires Redis to function properly
   - Impact: Without Redis, rate limits are per-instance only
   - Mitigation: Redis is now required in production (enforced)

3. **Credit Reconciliation**: No automated reconciliation job yet
   - Impact: May need manual reconciliation if bugs occur
   - Mitigation: Monitor credit transactions, implement reconciliation job (P1)

---

## Support Contacts

If issues occur during deployment:

1. **Redis Issues**: Check Redis provider dashboard (Upstash/Redis Cloud)
2. **Database Issues**: Contact database administrator
3. **Application Errors**: Check application logs at `/var/log/lumiku/`
4. **Credit System Issues**: Contact senior backend engineer for reconciliation

- Add credit reconciliation job (P1)
- Load test credit system under production load (P1)
- Set up automated monitoring and alerts

### Medium-term (Within 1 month)
- Review and optimize Redis usage
- Add comprehensive integration tests
- Document incident response procedures
- Conduct security audit of credit system
