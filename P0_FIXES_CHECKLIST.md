## Testing Before Deployment

### Unit Tests
```bash
cd backend
npm test -- --grep "credit|auth|rate|websocket|queue"
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Test rate limiting
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/apps/pose-generator/generate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"projectId":"test"}'
# Run 6 times, 6th should return 429

# Test admin protection
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/apps/pose-generator/admin/metrics" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN"
# Should return 403 if not admin

# Test SQL injection prevention
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/apps/pose-generator/library?search=%25%20OR%201=1--" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
# Should sanitize input
```

### Load Testing
```bash
# Test concurrent credit deductions (race condition prevention)
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/apps/pose-generator/generate" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    -d '{"projectId":"test"}' &
done
wait

# Check credit balance - should be correct, no overdraft
```

### Memory Leak Testing
```bash
# Monitor Redis connections before
redis-cli CLIENT LIST | wc -l

# Connect/disconnect WebSocket 100 times
# (Use wscat or similar)

# Monitor Redis connections after
redis-cli CLIENT LIST | wc -l
# Should be stable (no leak)
```

---

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Staging Deployment
```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve 8 P0 security vulnerabilities

- SQL injection prevention in search queries
- Admin endpoint authorization enforcement
- Rate limiting on /generate endpoint
- CSRF vulnerability fix in WebSocket
- Race condition fix in credit deduction
- Job deduplication in queue system
- Memory leak fix in WebSocket subscribers

All fixes are production-ready with comprehensive error handling."

# Push to staging branch
git push origin development

# Deploy to staging
# (Use your deployment pipeline)
```

### Step 2: Staging Verification
```bash
# Run security scan
npm run security:scan

# Run integration tests against staging
npm run test:integration -- --env=staging

# Monitor staging logs for errors
kubectl logs -f deployment/lumiku-backend -n staging

# Verify rate limiting works
curl -X POST "https://staging.lumiku.com/api/apps/pose-generator/generate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $STAGING_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"projectId":"test"}'
# Run 6 times, check for 429 on 6th

# Monitor Redis connections
redis-cli -h staging-redis CLIENT LIST | wc -l
# Should be stable

# Monitor credit transactions
# Check database for any overdrafts (should be 0)
SELECT * FROM credits WHERE balance < 0;
```

### Step 3: Production Deployment
```bash
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge development

# Tag release
git tag -a v1.0.0-security-fixes -m "P0 security vulnerability fixes"
git push origin main --tags

# Deploy to production (blue-green deployment)
kubectl apply -f k8s/production/deployment.yaml

# Wait for new pods to be ready
kubectl rollout status deployment/lumiku-backend -n production

# Switch traffic to new version
kubectl set selector service/lumiku-backend -n production version=new

# Monitor for 10 minutes
kubectl logs -f deployment/lumiku-backend -n production
```

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring (24 Hours)

### Metrics to Watch

#### Rate Limiting Metrics
```bash
# Check rate limit violations
kubectl logs deployment/lumiku-backend -n production | grep "RATE_LIMIT_VIOLATION"

# Check 429 response rate
# Should be low (<1% of requests)

# Check average retry-after time
# Should be consistent with configured limits
```

#### Credit System Metrics
```bash
# Check for credit overdrafts (should be 0)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM credits WHERE balance < 0;

# Check transaction serialization time
SELECT AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (updated_at - created_at))) FROM credits
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
# Should be <100ms

# Check failed transactions due to insufficient balance
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM credits WHERE error_type = 'insufficient_credits';
```

#### Queue Metrics
```bash
# Check for duplicate jobs (should be 0)
redis-cli --raw HGETALL bull:pose-generation:jobs | grep "duplicate"

# Check job states
redis-cli HGETALL bull:pose-generation:counts
# waiting, active, completed, failed, delayed

# Check average job processing time
# Should be consistent with previous performance
```

#### WebSocket Metrics
```bash
# Check Redis subscriber count
redis-cli CLIENT LIST | grep "subscribe" | wc -l
# Should match active WebSocket connections

# Check for connection leaks
# Monitor over time - should be stable

# Check cleanup logs
kubectl logs deployment/lumiku-backend -n production | grep "Cleaned up Redis subscriber"
# Should see cleanup for every disconnect
```

#### Security Events
```bash
# Check SQL injection attempts
kubectl logs deployment/lumiku-backend -n production | grep "SQL injection"

# Check unauthorized admin access attempts
kubectl logs deployment/lumiku-backend -n production | grep "Forbidden.*admin"

# Check WebSocket CSRF attempts
kubectl logs deployment/lumiku-backend -n production | grep "query param.*rejected"
```

### Alerts to Set Up

1. **High Rate Limit Violations**
   - Alert if >5% of requests return 429
   - Action: Investigate if legitimate traffic or attack

2. **Credit Overdraft Detected**
   - Alert if ANY credit balance goes negative
   - Action: Immediate investigation (should never happen)

3. **Duplicate Jobs Detected**
   - Alert if duplicate jobs created
   - Action: Check queue logic

4. **Redis Connection Spike**
   - Alert if subscriber count increases >20% in 1 hour
   - Action: Check for WebSocket leak

5. **Security Violations**
   - Alert on any SQL injection attempts
   - Alert on unauthorized admin access
   - Action: Log and investigate source

---

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are detected:

### Immediate Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/lumiku-backend -n production

# Verify rollback successful
kubectl rollout status deployment/lumiku-backend -n production

# Check application health
curl -X GET "https://api.lumiku.com/health"
```

### Partial Rollback (Specific Fix)
```bash
# Identify problematic commit
git log --oneline -10

# Revert specific fix
git revert <commit-hash>

# Deploy hotfix
git push origin main
# (Deployment pipeline will trigger)
```
