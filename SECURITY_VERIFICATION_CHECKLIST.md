## 5. Performance

### 5.1 Database Indexes

**Required Indexes:**
```sql
-- Verify indexes exist
SHOW INDEX FROM CarouselProject WHERE Column_name = 'userId';
SHOW INDEX FROM VideoMixerProject WHERE Column_name = 'userId';
SHOW INDEX FROM LoopingFlowProject WHERE Column_name = 'userId';
SHOW INDEX FROM AvatarProject WHERE Column_name = 'userId';
```

- [x] CarouselProject.userId indexed
- [x] VideoMixerProject.userId indexed
- [x] LoopingFlowProject.userId indexed
- [x] AvatarProject.userId indexed

**If missing, create:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_carousel_project_userId ON CarouselProject(userId);
CREATE INDEX idx_video_mixer_project_userId ON VideoMixerProject(userId);
CREATE INDEX idx_looping_flow_project_userId ON LoopingFlowProject(userId);
CREATE INDEX idx_avatar_project_userId ON AvatarProject(userId);
```

### 5.2 Query Performance

**Benchmark Authorization Checks:**

```typescript
// Test: Authorization check should be < 50ms
const start = performance.now()
await authorizationService.verifyCarouselProjectOwnership(userId, projectId)
const duration = performance.now() - start
console.log(`Authorization check: ${duration}ms`)
// Expected: < 50ms ✅
```

- [x] Authorization checks < 50ms
- [x] No N+1 query problems
- [x] Batch operations efficient
- [x] Memory usage stable

## 6. Security Verification

### 6.1 Information Leakage Prevention

**Verify 404 instead of 403:**

```bash
# Test: Unauthorized access should return 404, not 403
curl -i -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/apps/carousel-mix/projects/[OTHER_USER_PROJECT]" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [USER_TOKEN]" | grep "HTTP"
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found ✅ (NOT 403)
```

- [x] Returns 404 for unauthorized access (not 403)
- [x] Error messages don't reveal resource existence
- [x] No userId or email leakage in errors
- [x] No stack traces exposed to users

### 6.2 Audit Logging

**Verify logs are generated:**

```bash
# Trigger authorization failure
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/apps/carousel-mix/projects/[OTHER_USER_PROJECT]" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [USER_TOKEN]"

# Check logs
tail -f backend/logs/app.log | grep "\[SECURITY\]"
# Expected: [SECURITY] Authorization failure: {...} ✅
```

- [x] Authorization failures logged
- [x] Log includes userId, resourceType, resourceId
- [x] Log includes timestamp
- [x] Log includes failure reason
- [x] Logs don't contain sensitive data (passwords, tokens)

### 6.3 Penetration Testing

**Attack Scenarios:**

1. **ID Enumeration:**
```bash
# Try sequential IDs
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
    "http://localhost:3000/api/apps/carousel-mix/projects/clx${i}" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]"
done
# Expected: All 404 ✅
```

2. **SQL Injection:**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/apps/carousel-mix/projects/'; DROP TABLE CarouselProject; --" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]"
# Expected: 404 (SQL injection prevented by Prisma) ✅
```

3. **Race Condition:**
```bash
# Attempt concurrent unauthorized access
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/api/apps/carousel-mix/slides/[OTHER_USER_SLIDE]" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]" &
done
wait
# Expected: All 404 ✅
```

- [x] ID enumeration returns 404 for all attempts
- [x] SQL injection blocked
- [x] Race conditions don't bypass authorization
- [x] Timing attacks not possible (consistent 404 response time)
